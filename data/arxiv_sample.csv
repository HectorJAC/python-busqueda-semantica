"Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and
  LHC energies","C. Bal\'azs, E. L. Berger, P. M. Nadolsky, C.-P. Yuan","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is
presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions,Ileana Streinu and Louis Theran,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.

"The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field
  fluid model",Hongjun Pan,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

"A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
  single-source automata",David Callan,"  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic
single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to
certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the
determinant.
"
From dyadic $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ to $\Lambda_{\alpha}$,Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky,"  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge
0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of
the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms.
"
Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance,Y. H. Pong and C. K. Law,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with
tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair
wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.
"
Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit,"Alejandro Corichi, Tatjana Vukasinac and Jose A. Zapata","  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation
relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has
gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck
scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric
sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore
different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and
the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive
the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple
cosmological model.

"Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material
  properties",Damian C. Swift,"  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for
applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The
  Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS","Paul Harvey, Bruno Merin, Tracy L. Huard, Luisa M. Rebull, Nicholas
  Chapman, Neal J. Evans II, Philip C. Myers","  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy
observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

"Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions",Sergei Ovchinnikov,"  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph
defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play
an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed
in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary
dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known
results are given.
  The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and
contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes
from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite
partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.

"Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via
  the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence",Clifton Cunningham and Lassina Dembele,"  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of
Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number
one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that
are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.

"Distribution of integral Fourier Coefficients of a Modular Form of Half
  Integral Weight Modulo Primes",Dohoon Choi,"  Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does
not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this
paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of
half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem
we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of
singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's
conjecture for overpartitions.

"$p$-adic Limit of Weakly Holomorphic Modular Forms of Half Integral
  Weight",Dohoon Choi and YoungJu Choie,"  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of
modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend
the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight
on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among
Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications
we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of
Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point
are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of
Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.

Iterated integral and the loop product,Koichi Fujii,"  In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and

Fermionic superstring loop amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism,Christian Stahn,"  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to
manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure
spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these
integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop
and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond
states.
"
Lifetime of doubly charmed baryons,"Chao-Hsi Chang, Tong Li, Xue-Qian Li and Yu-Ming Wang","  In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons
$\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate
the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed
diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the
simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are
generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark
model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order
larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This
discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate
experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be
some unknown mechanism to be explored.

"Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in
  Quiescence","Nceba Mhlahlo, David H. Buckley, Vikram S. Dhillon, Steven B. Potter,
  Brian Warner and Patric A. Woudt","  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya
in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.
"
In quest of a generalized Callias index theorem,Andreas Gustavsson,"  We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as
regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all
odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the
moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in
even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter
can be applied to this index problem.

"Approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on

Measurement of the Hadronic Form Factor in D0 --> K- e+ nue Decays,"The BABAR Collaboration, B. Aubert, et al","  The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue
has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical
calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the
PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction,
relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0
--> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these
results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the
normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/-
0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic,
and from external inputs, respectively.

"Molecular Synchronization Waves in Arrays of Allosterically Regulated
  Enzymes","Vanessa Casagrande, Yuichi Togashi, Alexander S. Mikhailov","  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at
high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that
catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that
complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis
based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns
result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered
system.
"
Stochastic Lie group integrators,Simon J.A. Malham and Anke Wiese,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential
equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth
finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport
along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.
Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid
body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by
two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.
"
ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere,"M. A. Loukitcheva, S. K. Solanki and S. White","  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics,
remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research.
Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter
wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out
with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson
and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to
dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look
for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests
that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by
ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool
gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

"Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film
  media","A.A. Serga, M. Kostylev, and B. Hillebrands","  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized
stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved
Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that
the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the
lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic
magnetization takes place at the edges.
  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a
waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction
with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The
experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the
shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the
confinement.

"Placeholder Substructures II: Meta-Fractals, Made of Box-Kites, Fill
  Infinite-Dimensional Skies",Robert P. C. de Marrais,"  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from
N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent
singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free
networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a
meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an
ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental
building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes""
provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context
of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity.

Filling-Factor-Dependent Magnetophonon Resonance in Graphene,"M. O. Goerbig, J.-N. Fuchs, K. Kechedzhi, Vladimir I. Fal'ko","  We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon
at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of
the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most
pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman
spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and
(-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the
strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor
dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice
modes.

"Pfaffians, hafnians and products of real linear functionals",P\'eter E. Frenkel,"  We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants

is sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem).

"Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor-Spin
  Structure within Chiral Quark Model","Zhan Shu, Xiao-Lin Chen and Wei-Zhen Deng","  In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in
the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon
flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of
constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission
process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$,
the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the
obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a
quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in
nucleon flavor-spin structure.

Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions,J.P.Hague and N.d'Ambrumenil,"  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation
effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime
where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations
and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several
interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the
spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral
function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since
the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral
function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low
frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double
kondo peak arrangement

"Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons with preserved distribution in
  phase space","V. M. Biryukov (Serpukhov, IHEP)","  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of
particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold
distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In
simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the
accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from
the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set
the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton
angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1
microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward
protons at the LHC.

Probing non-standard neutrino interactions with supernova neutrinos,"A. Esteban-Pretel, R. Tom\`as and J. W. F. Valle","  We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions
(NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future
galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino
propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying
special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which
may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility
of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through
modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock
waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron
fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible
detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$
spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant
conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for
very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.

"Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. I. Theoretical
  analysis","Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete
dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are
bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when
the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is
significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.

  technique to increase the accuracy","Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the
discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique
was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using
many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with
refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for
cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was
demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were
proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate
shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.

A remark on the number of steady states in a multiple futile cycle,Liming Wang and Eduardo D. Sontag,"  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly
used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic
behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive
feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a
general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number
of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show
analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n
is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1
steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single
levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for
parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions,
there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the
standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one
steady state.

"The discrete dipole approximation for simulation of light scattering by
  particles much larger than the wavelength","Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole
Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger
than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly
available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles
required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by
spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and
2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory.
Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally
increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times
increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a
cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program
is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of
computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large
particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current
limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.
"
The discrete dipole approximation: an overview and recent developments,"Maxim A. Yurkin, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a
general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We
put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking
the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the
electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects,
the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the
method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light
scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.

Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor,Jose A. Oller and Luis Roca,"  The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role
for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain,
using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar
form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger
than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es
equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both
values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and
show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under
tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for
some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the
resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error
in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave
I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not
yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from
QCD.

conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by
positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents
several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an
analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of
multilinear function series.
"
Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry,Debashish Goswami,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of
Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a
natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a
classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then
proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group)
in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on
a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity
assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal
object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth
isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct
a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold
which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the
quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups
of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum
double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of
holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.

"General System theory, Like-Quantum Semantics and Fuzzy Sets",Ignazio Licata,"  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to
the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a
quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It
is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between
observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of
quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful
for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum
coherence.

Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods,"R.A. Brownlee, A.N. Gorban, J. Levesley","  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice
Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without
blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the
same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes
and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction
of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar
quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)
based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii)
based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical
properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy
production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.
All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic
quasiequilibria.

"Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in
  magnetized weakly collisional plasmas","A. A. Schekochihin (Oxford), S. C. Cowley (Culham), W. Dorland
  (Maryland), G. W. Hammett (Princeton), G. G. Howes (Iowa), E. Quataert
  (Berkeley), T. Tatsuno (Maryland)","  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical
plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

"Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows
  over a gradual slope with bottom friction","G.A. El, R.H.J. Grimshaw, A.M. Kamchatnov","  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear
periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a
variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging
method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable
equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results
on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost,"I. Csiszar, F. Hiai and D. Petz","  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a
conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the
relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in
this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the
quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel
capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to
generalization of the conjecture.

"Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:
  Part I",T. Kosel and I. Grabec,"  The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part
II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.
  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is
a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent

Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal
detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased
in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal

the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine
accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.

An algorithm for the classification of smooth Fano polytopes,Mikkel {\O}bro,"  We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fano
d-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number,
namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smooth
Fano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano

"Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:
  Part II",T. Kosel and I. Grabec,"  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II
discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
continuous acoustic emission sources.
  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.

Visualizing Teleportation,Scott M. Cohen,"  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described,
allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and
providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon.
The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining
teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first
explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical
description, out of which teleportation arises naturally.

Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries,Arthur Jaffe (1) and Gordon Ritter (1) ((1) Harvard University),"  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including
interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean
quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the
isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either
self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the
self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a
unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian
manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose
Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.

A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds,"Nabil L. Youssef, S. H. Abed and A. Soleiman","  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the
theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or
intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most
commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald,
Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible,
semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent,
$C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of
the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like,
$R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant
curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global
definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various
relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler
manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely
global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local
counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special
Finsler spaces considered.

singular integrals and other operators acting on them.

"Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional
  study","Eleni Ziambaras, Jesper Kleis, Elsebeth Schroder, and Per Hyldgaard","  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles
theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well
accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from
pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite
interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal
approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.
"
Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics,Santi Prestipino and Franz Saija,"  We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel
ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After
identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful
zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we
determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the
help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this
model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar
phase for intermediate temperatures.

"High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in
  multiorbital Mott systems",Philipp Werner and Andrew J. Millis,"  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a
two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two
electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field
theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong
couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location
of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange
coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive
the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital
susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce
an orbital selective Mott state.
"
Intelligent Life in Cosmology,Frank J. Tipler,"  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is
very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of
the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the
evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall
develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show
that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available
resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle
of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to
survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is
indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent
life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I
shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over
antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.

"The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined
  Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013","T. G. Beatty, J. M. Fernandez, D. W. Latham, G. A. Bakos, G. Kovacs,
  R. W. Noyes, R. P. Stefanik, G. Torres, M. E. Everett, C. W. Hergenrother","  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing
binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf
secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with
an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04
\pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical
mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from
double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity
to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies,"C.A. Bertulani, G. Cardella, M. De Napoli, G. Raciti, and E. Rapisarda","  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei
in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is
shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at
lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb
distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon
and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam
facilities are discussed.

Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms,Boris Rubin,"  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects
associated with sections of star bodies and invoking
  Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier
analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized
cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to
investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call
$\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the
sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of
$L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional
subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine
transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to
the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of
this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some
known facts and give them new proofs.

On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks,"Rastislav \v{S}r\'amek, Bro\v{n}a Brejov\'a, Tom\'a\v{s} Vina\v{r}","  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both
simulated and real DNA sequences.

Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay,Somnath Choudhury,"  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in
non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the
standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of
neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the
process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first
experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence
of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing
efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana
experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed
study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.

"Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the
  (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories",R. P. Malik (Bhu),"  We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the
Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form
gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular,
we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry
invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the
specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism.
Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge
theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism
where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional
supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu =
0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of
the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification
in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry
invariance.
"
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials,A. I. Molev,"  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an
infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.
Okounkov and G. Olshanski.

"Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation
  relations for free fields","Bozhidar Z. Iliev (Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy,
  Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria)","  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory
of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical
view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg
equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for
uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some
class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their
generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity
of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg
equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is
solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal
ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies
corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction
of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation
relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables
is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed
the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum
mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the
only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not
contradict to the existing data.
"
Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis,Lawrence H. Friedman,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for
nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,John W. Robertson,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be
exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was
found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an
oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A
number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have
been found.

"The decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals
  of nonlinear PDEs of any order with any number of independent variables",Yu.N. Kosovtsov,"  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of
some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on
decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders.
It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s),
each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for
one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression
of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.
Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its
highest derivatives.
  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really
solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent
variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate
a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.

A transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem,Osamu Fujino,"  We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential

implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is
formulated for a compact K\""ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of
harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\""ahler metric.
We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral
sequence.

Injective Morita contexts (revisited),"J. Y. Abuhlail, S. K. Nauman","  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in
which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita
$\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local
projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in
which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the
bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita
semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will
be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish
equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories
of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.
We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and

Strong decays of charmed baryons,"Chong Chen, Xiao-Lin Chen, Xiang Liu, Wei-Zhen Deng and Shi-Lin Zhu","  There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons
in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave,
D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After
comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data,
we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed
baryons observed recently.

CP violation in beauty decays,Michael Gronau,"  Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed,

"
Universal Forces and the Dark Energy Problem,Afsar Abbas,"  The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our
understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental
Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of
Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to
providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown
how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.

"Linear perturbations of matched spacetimes: the gauge problem and
  background symmetries","Marc Mars, Filipe C. Mena, Raul Vera","  We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of
matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced
in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit
the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis
includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell
cosmologies.

Operator algebras associated with unitary commutation relations,"Stephen C. Power (Lancaster University), Baruch Solel (Technion)","  We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},...,
L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations of
the form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u=
(u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which
generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single
vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.
"
"Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical
  Evaporation",Dean E. McLaughlin and S. Michael Fall,"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way
depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

Quantum Deformations of Relativistic Symmetries,"V.N. Tolstoy (INP, Moscow State University)","  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In
the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices

Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form.

"Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor
  Bose-Einstein Condensates","Tetsuo Kurosaki, Miki Wadati","  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite
background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an
integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the
inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The
resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under
vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit
manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into
two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies
the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the
polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton
collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a
collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the
previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and
dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of
the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.
"
Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?,A.O.Barvinsky,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested
density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble
in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one)
distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the
observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the
{\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained
cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological
constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages
of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within
the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the
bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble
suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and,
simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of
the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.

"Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely
  cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions","Itzhak Fouxon, Baruch Meerson, Michael Assaf, Eli Livne","  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of
clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider
large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be
neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an
additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We
employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary
analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These
solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in
a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups
signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up
time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim
(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while
the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock
discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the
singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas
pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time
close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density
blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the
hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the
exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving
the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions
show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,
independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.
"
A Universality in PP-Waves,Partha Mukhopadhyay,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in
space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the
space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field
configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the
pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the
background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial
fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell
pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal
sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to
the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results
can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also
study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In
particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse
space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition
relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive
modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this
simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on
the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an
iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT
equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses
can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.
"
Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas,Vladislav V. Vysotsky,"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of
one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles
that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds.
Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles
collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass
and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the
asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the
number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our
main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on
the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states
that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of
neighbor particles.

"Approximate solutions to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between

spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function
$f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries
of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map
$u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of
Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.

Some new experimental photonic flame effect features,N.V.Tcherniega,"  The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of
radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented.
Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling
point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long-
term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured
spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible
luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial
opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with
different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and
the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is
being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the
Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of
the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same
as in opal matrixes.

"A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws:
  nonparametric regression",I. Grabec,"  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the
probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by
experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively
by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical
law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental
data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the
kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The
proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy
chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict
a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor
error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is
expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are
used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the
predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.

Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS),Lester Ingber,"  Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive
sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA)
optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple
Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability
distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability
distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on

develop a relative risk analysis among projects.
"
Groups with finitely many conjugacy classes and their automorphisms,Ashot Minasyan,"  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of
small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely
generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate
elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such
groups.
  As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable
group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$,
where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and
containing exactly two conjugacy classes.

Energy density for chiral lattice fermions with chemical potential,Christof Gattringer and Ludovit Liptak,"  We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite

chemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior.

"Aspects of Electron-Phonon Self-Energy Revealed from Angle-Resolved
  Photoemission Spectroscopy","W.S. Lee, S. Johnston, T.P. Devereaux, and Z.-X. Shen","  Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated
oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions.
Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such
as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated
oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be
the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate
superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including
the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects,
the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We
show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these
arguments are not well founded.

"Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters: barely enough time
  and gravity to accelerate the bullet","HongSheng Zhao (SUPA, St Andrews)","  We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the
merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments.
We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data.
{\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a
total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move
with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x
10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our
results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of
$4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of
Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter
$M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le
1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.
"
"Geometry of Locally Compact Groups of Polynomial Growth and Shape of
  Large Balls",Emmanuel Breuillard,"  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally
compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the
geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show
that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie
group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an
asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a
limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss
the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to
ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant
metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series
of nilpotent groups.

Sparsely-spread CDMA - a statistical mechanics based analysis,"Jack Raymond, David Saad","  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA
method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively

limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading
matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a
comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.

On Ando's inequalities for convex and concave functions,Koenraad M.R. Audenaert and Jaspal Singh Aujla,"  For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the
inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le
||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative
operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These
inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave
functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,
and Kosem, respectively.
  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||
f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|)
|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a
similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer
exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively
in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.
  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated
majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself
a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows
to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.
"
Topology Change of Black Holes,Daisuke Ida and Masaru Siino,"  The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms
of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be
understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain
constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n
kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii)
Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black
handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an
exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is
shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from
that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat
space-times.

"A geometric realization of sl(6,C)","Giovanni Gaiffi, Michele Grassi","  Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a
geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra
L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an
explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L.
This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a
natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study
of a rich and interesting algebraic structure.
"
Rigid subsets of symplectic manifolds,Michael Entov and Leonid Polterovich,"  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of
sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by
symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of
rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment
maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following
the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly
singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth
functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity
of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the
Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states.

Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering,"Andreas Schafer, Xin-Nian Wang and Ben-Wei Zhang","  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to
quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied
systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic
scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$,
twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit
the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon
bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon
scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark
(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the
ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)
distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark
distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and
antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively
explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron
suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark
annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the
large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet
quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

Half-metallic silicon nanowires,"Engin Durgun, Deniz Cakir, Nurten Akman, and Salim Ciraci","  From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM)
atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are
insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the
opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon
nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment
and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The
spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of
dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are
not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on
spintronic applications of silicon nanowires.

"Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon
  nanotubes from bulk materials","Xiaolin Li, Li Zhang, Xinran Wang, Iwao Shimoyama, Xiaoming Sun,
  Won-Seok Seo and Hongjie Dai (Department of Chemistry, Stanford University.)","  Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface
properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future
manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into
aligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine
SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high
current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel
SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of
aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer
functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in
an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film
compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and
packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy.
The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by
microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest
regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.

Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet,"Valeri N. Kotov, Dao-Xin Yao, A. H. Castro Neto, D. K. Campbell","  We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with
nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)
  This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously
dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the
critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits
strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a
low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle
density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense
at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach,
which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the
transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the
critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding
the order of the transition.

Lamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a driving
Jaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approach
we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it
available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground
state in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under
the RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin
dependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference
between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant
experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum
information processing.

"Strained single-crystal Al2O3 grown layer-by-layer on Nb (110) thin
  films",Paul B. Welander and James N. Eckstein,"  We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on
Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire,
followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of
Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray
diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb
lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further
deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth.
Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer,
the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.

"Quasi-quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal
  CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal","A. Thamizhavel, R. Kulkarni and S. K. Dhar","  We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for the
first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by
measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific
heat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at
$T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal
strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 K
exhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rm
m2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6
$\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse
susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states
of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state.
The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced
energy levels.

Strong Phase and $D^0-D^0bar$ mixing at BES-III,"Xiao-Dong Cheng, Kang-Lin He, Hai-Bo Li, Yi-Fang Wang, Mao-Zhi Yang","  Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral
$D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase
difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing
parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity
of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III
experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements
of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase
difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold
with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.

Meta-Stable Brane Configuration of Product Gauge Groups,Changhyun Ahn,"  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and
bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and
obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge
singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe
the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable
nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold
6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with
fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c')
gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.

Spinor dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates; Classical spin approach,"M. Takahashi, Sankalpa Ghosh, T. Mizushima, K. Machida","  Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are
discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a
classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective
minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By
solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where
the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap
geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole
interaction.

"Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave
  Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator",D. N. Makovetskii,"  The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and
numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum
generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works
arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050)
Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films,"Huan Yang, Ying Jia, Lei Shan, Yingzi Zhang, Hai-Hu Wen, Chenggang
  Zhuang, Zikui Liu, Qi Li, Yi Cui, Xiaoxing Xi","  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been
studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H
between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V
isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show
a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down
to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in
terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may
be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.
Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled
according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent
effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots,"Randy K. Dumas, Chang-Peng Li, Igor V. Roshchin, Ivan K. Schuller and
  Kai Liu","  Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also
exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are
comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic
""fingerprints"" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to
vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As
the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal
striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis
loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity
distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a
calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm
nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the
vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives
quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation
and annihilation fields.

Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate
accurate light curves rapidly.
  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data
arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

Vacuum Structure and Potential,J.X. Zheng-Johansson,"  Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, I
developed a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formation
scheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists in
that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons,
consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of
zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a
Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005)
and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier
accessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding
quantitative determination of the vacuuon size.

Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts,"V.S. Khrapai, S. Ludwig, J.P. Kotthaus, H.P. Tranitz, W. Wegscheider","  We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated
quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the
drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased,
detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the
opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is
maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its
quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We
interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced
excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.

PAH emission and star formation in the host of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf QSO,"D. Lutz, E. Sturm, L.J. Tacconi, E. Valiante, M. Schweitzer, H.
  Netzer, R. Maiolino, P. Andreani, O. Shemmer, S. Veilleux","  We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH'
emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS
spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH
features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower
luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs,
supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge
far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's

~3E7yr) star forming event.

Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions,A. K. Chaudhuri,"  In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is
studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are
solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations.
Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the
same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity
profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of
the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as
viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics.
For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal
viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to
non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be
mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.

A Single Trapped Ion as a Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator,Nicolas C. Menicucci and G. J. Milburn,"  We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of important
physical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itself
functions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronic
transitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed that
an exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal)
Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian used
was incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal,
correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actual
spectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares an
important experimental signature with this result.

"Compounding Fields and Their Quantum Equations in the Trigintaduonion
  Space",Zihua Weng,"  The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the
trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion
electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic,
gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions
of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which
are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the
trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and
strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field
source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results
show that there may exist some new particles in the nature.

"Topological defects, geometric phases, and the angular momentum of light",S C Tiwari,"  Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams are
analyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spin
redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological
phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A
unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition.
Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with
the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent
with our conjecture.

"Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr
  spacetimes","Enrico Barausse, Scott A. Hughes, Luciano Rezzolla","  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a
nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS)
population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central
regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the
cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a
bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular
clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations
suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar
collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer
processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial
distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal
radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an
""evaporating"" BSS.

Entanglement entropy of two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter black holes,Mariano Cadoni,"  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement
entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The
leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces
exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term
behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for
the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal
fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical
point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional
conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and
is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.

Some aspects of the nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model,J. Kaupuzs,"  A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First we
integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q.
Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation
of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k <
Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation
is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration
results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the
phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare
the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic
perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which
sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.

Eternal inflation and localization on the landscape,"D. Podolsky, K. Enqvist","  We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of a
dense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}+\delta V(\phi)$,
where $|\delta V(\phi)|\ll V_{0}$ is random. We find that the diffusion of the
distribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in
different Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the
Anderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only the
localized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives which
leads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to
measure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble
patch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$.

Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory,"N. G. Parker, B. Jackson, A. M. Martin, and C. S. Adams","  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid
flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf
r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the
fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

A POVM view of the ensemble approach to polarization optics,"Sudha, A. V. Gopala Rao, A. R. Usha Devi and A. K. Rajagopal","  Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4,
433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of
stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of
transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller
transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is
observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive
operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This
observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne
(Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum
measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements
can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way
of realizing different types of Mueller devices.

"Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from
  equation-of-motion approach","J. H. Jiang, Y. Y. Wang, and M. W. Wu","  The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in
semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach
for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various
mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon
interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due
to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the
electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine
interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin
decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the
spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked
effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying
both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either
in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite
temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,
though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.

illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial
data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given.

"Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a
  Magnetic Field",Bo Gu and Gang Su,"  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond
chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0
(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with
our TMRG results.

Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data,I. Grabec,"  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x
and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability
density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose
kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)
the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the
introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly
related variables.

Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing,"V.I. Abrosimov, D.M. Brink, A.Dellafiore, F. Matera","  The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent
Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$
approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number
conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal
response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A
simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number
conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the
correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is
shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum
has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The
collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual
interaction.

"Reciprocal Symmetry and Classical Discrete Oscillator Incorporating
  Half-Integral Energy Levels",Mushfiq Ahmad,"  Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding
(finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that
it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest
span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally
related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the
other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to
0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of
half-integers.

Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment,"Fabian Eichstaedt, Stefan Leupold, Ulrich Mosel, Pascal Muehlich","  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium
selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we
demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of
the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian;
more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any
mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral
functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay
branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a
quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be
part of any reliable theory.

"A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line
  spectra","Floris van der Tak (SRON Groningen), John Black (Onsala), Fredrik
  Schoeier (Stockholm), David Jansen and Ewine van Dishoeck (Leiden)","  The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line
observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and
chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We
present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular
lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium
calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including
radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an
escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at
http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of
molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database
(LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of
the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated
methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters
from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should
form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio
and infrared telescopes.

"Alternative Approaches to the Equilibrium Properties of Hard-Sphere
  Liquids","M. Lopez de Haro, S. B. Yuste, and A. Santos","  An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the
structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent
hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a
thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the
known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions
for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the
corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of
this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and
square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation
theory of fluids are briefly addressed.

Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences,"Fangcui Zhao, Huijie Yang, and Binghong Wang","  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance
characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for
the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at
$\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left
and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are
asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths,
respectively.

Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$,"H. Cercellier, C. Monney, F. Clerc, C. Battaglia, L. Despont, M. G.
  Garnier, H. Beck, L. Patthey, H. Berger, P. Aebi","  We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of
1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its
low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the
photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations
at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of
spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral
function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features
with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic
insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in
1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.

Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM,"G. Stasinska, G. Tenorio-Tagle, M. Rodriguez, W. J. Henney","  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances
derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines
(CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the
interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario,
the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined
within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only
after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling
down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these
metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next
generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give
rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed
ORL-CEL discrepancy. (The full version of this work is submitted to Astronomy

Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen
vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the

exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft
phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit,
with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid
disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.
"
Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics,I. Grabec,"  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the
complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed
for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the
entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of
experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to
integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and
information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of
the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments
needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost
function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is
demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.

Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data,"Peter Brommer and Franz G\""ahler (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und
  Angewandte Physik, Universit\""at Stuttgart)","  Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale
atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially
depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like
quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically
inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials
especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force
matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to
optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen
reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio
methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co,
icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have
been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of
specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.
"
On smooth foliations with Morse singularities,Lilia Rosati,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.
"
Frobenius-Schur indicators for semisimple Lie algebras,Mohammad Abu-Hamed and Shlomo Gelaki,"  Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a
finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth
Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We
deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m,
the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For
the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case
for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.

Supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua in runaway quiver gauge theories,"Inaki Garcia-Etxebarria, Fouad Saad, Angel M. Uranga","  In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose
infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We
show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact
branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely
related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the
one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct
computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach
allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the
results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to
generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary
values of the superpotential couplings.

Low Energy Aspects of Heavy Meson Decays,Jan O. Eeg,"  I discuss low energy aspects of heavy meson decays, where there is at least

"Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic
  shocks",Paul Dempsey and Peter Duffy,"  We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of
electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle
diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and
also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A
semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour
of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the
particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of
relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are
discussed.

Symmetry disquisition on the TiOX phase diagram,"Daniele Fausti, Tom T. A. Lummen, Cosmina Angelescu, Roberto Macovez,
  Javier Luzon, Ria Broer, Petra Rudolf, Paul H.M. van Loosdrecht, Natalia
  Tristan, Bernd Buchner, Sander van Smaalen, Angela Moller, Gerd Meyer, Timo
  Taetz","  The sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the low
temperature incommensurate and spin-Peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensional
inorganic spin-Peierls system TiOX (TiOBr and TiOCl) have been studied using
inelastic light scattering experiments. The anomalous first-order character of
the transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the
different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$)
phases.
  The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly
suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the
formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a
comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy
scattering observed previously has a phononic origin.

Discovery of a point-like very-high-energy gamma-ray source in Monoceros,"F. Aharonian, et al","  The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains several
potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yet
unidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are required
to probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array
has been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region.
CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the
region, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via
hadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source,
HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is
unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is
possibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the
Be-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. No

Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice,"S. El Shawish, A. Ramsak, and J. Bonca","  We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement
between spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can be
qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact
diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of
fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap
in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap
are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model.

"Reparametrization Invariance, the controversial extraction of $\alpha$
  from $B\to\pi\pi$ and New Physics","Francisco J. Botella (Valencia U. & Valencia U., IFIC), Miguel Nebot
  (Lisbon, IST)","  The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has been
controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian
confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not
deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$.
Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.

Solar System Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Mediated Dark Energy,"Luca Amendola, Christos Charmousis and Stephen C. Davis","  Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general
relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying
gravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due
to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional
source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential,
and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We
constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini
spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding
extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We
discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological
acceleration.

"Switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular
  junctions","Jing Huang, Qunxiang Li, Hao Ren, Haibin Su, Q. W. Shi, and Jinlong
  Yang","  The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single
photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with
closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent
nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory.
The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly
distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a
wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission
peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties
of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are
mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the
experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior
within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or
S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.

of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test

magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) and
linear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combination
with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic coupling
between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are
able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic
orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time.
We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of
magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline
anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high
sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments
at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in
a metallic system.

  Nanotubes: O(N) Tight Binding MD Simulation","G. Dereli and B. Sungu (Yildiz Tech. Univ., Istanbul)","  This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability and
mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics
(TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its
structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in
compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing
temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit,
Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10,
0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range
from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of
300K to 900K.

"Dark energy and neutrino model in SUSY -- Remarks on active and sterile
  neutrinos mixing --",Ryo Takahashi and Morimitsu Tanimoto,"  We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory.
The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the
gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was
broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the
equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It
is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of
the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on
cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed
neutrino variable.

"The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of

  (1) ((1) Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, (2) Hamburger Sternwarte, (3)
  Universit\""at Potsdam)","  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of
the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

Biased random walks on combs,Tanya M Elliott and John F Wheater,"  We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased
random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral
dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine.
Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb
with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the
spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We
also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability
measures.

Monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups,J. C. Birget,"  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized
in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids,
called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial
functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections
with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1}
and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D
are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1
non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz
algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any
finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain
infinite generating sets.

that the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of the

SK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking,
we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time

  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons
under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained
under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of
the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside
the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds
irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.

Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution,"Peter Virnau (1), Leonid A. Mirny (1,2), Mehran Kardar (1) ((1)
  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Physics, Cambridge, MA,
  United States of America, (2) Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
  Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology, Cambridge, MA, United
  States of America)","  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather
unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots
are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein
function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein
Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

Star Formation in Galaxies with Large Lower Surface Brightness Disks,"K. O'Neil, S. Oey, G. Bothun","  We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whose
properties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxies
and ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the
Lowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology,
color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range from
Sb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors
of the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slight
bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of these
galaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similar
samples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies
studied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emission
than is found in higher surface brightness samples.

"Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by
  fluctuating environment",S.A. Gurvitz and D. Mozyrsky,"  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of
single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.
The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing
dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.
Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

Group-theoretical properties of nilpotent modular categories,"Vladimir Drinfeld, Shlomo Gelaki, Dmitri Nikshych, Victor Ostrik","  We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power
Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of
finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits
an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have
integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a
consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power
dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of
twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this
is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in
terms of Manin pairs).

Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity,Steffen Schober and Martin Bossert,"  In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model
for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was
able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random
networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in
the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only
for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the
Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary
connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns
out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the
average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased
functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only
functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

Theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities,"L. M. Leon Hilario, A. Bruchhausen, A. M. Lobos, A. A. Aligia","  We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic light
scattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon coupling
nonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons and
photons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Taking
the matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellent
agreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant with
the upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantum
wells.

"Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised
  non-crossing partitions","Christian Krattenthaler (Universit\""at Wien) and Thomas M\""uller
  (Queen Mary & Westfield College, University of London)","  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and
types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter
groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a
Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a
subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation
is ""minimal"" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s,
$i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these
decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$
decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a
somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$
decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on
map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.
These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and
fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le
\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions
poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block
structure"" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies
all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

Electromagnetic polarizabilities and the excited states of the nucleon,Martin Schumacher,"  The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be
essentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$,
$\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$
and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of
$10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data
$\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm
1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number of
resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the
contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric
and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon
couplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeV
and two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.

introducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras.

A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula,"August A. Muench, Charles J. Lada, K. L. Luhman, James Muzerolle and
  Erick Young","  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star
cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42
class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the
supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should
not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

set by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can
be driven by tuning gate or bias voltages.

Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar PSR J1357-6429,"P. Esposito, A. Tiengo, A. De Luca, F. Mattana","  We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429
(characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra
satellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus
blackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160
eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV
luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy
channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.
The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and
allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a
compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the
source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the
X-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.

Resonant activation in bistable semiconductor lasers,"Stefano Lepri, Giovanni Giacomelli","  We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation

of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation
of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation
time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum.
The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional
Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to
both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several
experimental tests in such optical systems.

Some non-braided fusion categories of rank 3,Tobias J. Hagge and Seung-Moon Hong,"  We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three

types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and

pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary
re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to
the identity.

Chandra Observations of Supernova 1987A,"Sangwook Park, David N. Burrows, Gordon P. Garmire (Penn State),

Observatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\it
Chandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} data
obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of
SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates
from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like
dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's
equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now
sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is
rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),
X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component
plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As
the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray
remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$
than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).

Classification of superpotentials,"Andrew Dancer, Mckenzie Wang","  We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar

the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of
the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the
weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal
orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at
most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the
superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion
type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product.

Linkedness and ordered cycles in digraphs,"Daniela K\""uhn and Deryk Osthus","  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum

digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on
the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of
Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which
ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every
ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which
encounters these vertices in this order.

Curvature and isocurvature perturbations in two-field inflation,"Z. Lalak, D. Langlois, S. Pokorski, K. Turzynski","  We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for
non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature
and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll

isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of
inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently
proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect
significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of
inflation.

Ab initio Study of Graphene on SiC,Alexander Mattausch and Oleg Pankratov,"  Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene
layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast
to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the
substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum
observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene
appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals
bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface
is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single

"Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding
  Matrix",Wiroonsak Santipach and Michael L. Honig,"  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

  Patnaude, John P. Hughes, Fernando Camilo","  We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal
radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind
nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of
this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray
emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a
power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the
X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than
the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly
offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7
arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio
Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some
areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index
of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of
L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these
observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a
large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model
for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we
conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula
formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly
(<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),
low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a

Three Particle Correlations from STAR,Jason Glyndwr Ulery (for the STAR Collaboration),"  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in
central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au
collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large
angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent
energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical
flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle
correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,
conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the
dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can
be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from
QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal
correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles.
Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction
of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications
of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are
discussed.

highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial
origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this
epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In
this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps
fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe

approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass

Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au
collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition,
the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the
associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple
QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the
subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this
subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail.
"
Exploring First Stars Era with GLAST,A. Kashlinsky and D. Band,"  Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible
to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first
stars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced by
the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images.
Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of
high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST
sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on
energetics and constituents of the first stars era.

galaxies may hold the key to probe the gas orbital motions in the innermost
regions of accretion discs around black holes and, thus, trace flow patterns
under the effect of the hole strong gravitational field. We explore this
possibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.
A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest
possible time-scales (few ks) using ""excess maps"" and cross-correlating light
curves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K
alpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature
between 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks
that is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source
continuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe
line and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion
disc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the
redshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is
likely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole.

Isotopic Effects in Nuclear Reactions at Relativistic Energies,"C.Sfienti, M. De Napoli, S. Bianchin, A.S. Botvina, J. Brzychczyk, A.

"Einstein vs Maxwell: Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in
  flat space, or both?",Theo M. Nieuwenhuizen,"  Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the
gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in
a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration
tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space
cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy.
In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the
Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of
a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of
the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the
components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign,
leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is
covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the
total energy and the zero point energy vanish.

"Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive
  integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry",Ketan D. Mulmuley,"  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?,R. Duffard and F. Roig,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the
description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the
diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be
identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type
in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic
observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main
Belt.

algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased
algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way
to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent
progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector
using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation
to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as
periods of mixed (Tate) motives.

The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC,Thomas G. Rizzo,"  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged
gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such
particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In
this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling
helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery
channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution,
reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides
the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires
integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV
and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This
helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various
discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference
regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

"Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets:
  A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force","Geoffrey C. Bower (Berkeley), Alberto Bolatto (Berkeley), Eric Ford
  (CfA, Florida), Paul Kalas (Berkeley), Jim Ulvestad (NRAO)","  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an
important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of
exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve
better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond
with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric
PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope
that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet
mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass
planets possible.
  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.
  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods
demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap
for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

Interface dynamics of microscopic cavities in water,Joachim Dzubiella,"  An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsing
nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent molecular
dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two
approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent
conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be
corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or
collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and
fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction
accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover
scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit
modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in
nonequilibrium.

formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond
to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide
a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of
theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture.

"Superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model: Effects of vertex
  and non-local corrections",J.P.Hague,"  I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the
dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations
(non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and
incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation
is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the
bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are
calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond
Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows
momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order
is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to
Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation.

"Renormalized quasiparticles in antiferromagnetic states of the Hubbard
  model",J. Bauer and A.C. Hewson,"  We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallic
antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is
based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional
Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent
solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then
analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these
quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and
also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found
to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf
k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle
picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total
electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.

One-loop MHV Rules and Pure Yang-Mills,"Andreas Brandhuber, Bill Spence, Gabriele Travaglini, Konstantinos
  Zoubos","  It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of
perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in
one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain
Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which
give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms.
These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator,
introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations
of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our
proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the
generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity
amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.

two dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of the
lowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between the
relevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on the

"A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking
  (Invisibility)",Ricardo Weder,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.
"
Non-perturbative conserving approximations and Luttinger's sum rule,"Jutta Ortloff, Matthias Balzer, Michael Potthoff","  Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of
the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically
consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as
certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for
variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the
self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series.
Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under
which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation.
Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site
approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the
consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are
discussed.

2D-MIT as self-doping of a Wigner-Mott insulator,S. Pankov and V. Dobrosavljevic,"  We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensional

liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains
many puzzling features of the 2D-MIT.

correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show
that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is
a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we
provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we
analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces.

highest visual extinction.

Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves and Oscar Eboli,"  Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric
requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing
their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair
production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the
lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra
dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from
supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel
provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production
rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are
sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.

Modeling the three-point correlation function,"Felipe Marin (Chicago, KICP), Risa Wechsler (KIPAC, Stanford), Joshua

(3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat
LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic
mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos
and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and
color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are
varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated
3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements
lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM
halos and subhalos.

"Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I. Resolving The Dust
  Shell Around AFGL 5440",Paul M. Harvey and Andrew Oldag,"  We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the
dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a
continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed
spectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the
occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY
radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the
observed occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution
described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of
the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1.
The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the
gradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic
outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a
substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher
mass-loss rate in the past.

"Orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions and the case of

quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in
the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations
for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how
orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to
understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to
compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic
reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted
projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of
a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope.

the self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in
this example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent
$\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations the
procedure seems to converge rapidly.

better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

"Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from
  Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5","Scott W. Randall, Maxim Markevitch, Douglas Clowe, Anthony H.
  Gonzalez, and Marusa Bradac","  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak
lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

Stringy Instantons at Orbifold Singularities,"Riccardo Argurio, Matteo Bertolini, Gabriele Ferretti, Alberto Lerda
  and Christoffer Petersson","  We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic
quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects
are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory
instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the
prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic
zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They
are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory
instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We
analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow
for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the
effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway
directions.

  Distefano, G. Cutispoto, F. D'Alessio","  Spectral variability is the main tool for constraining emission models of BL
  Lac objects. By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS
2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of
months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm
telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS
2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.
On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states
of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability
episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare
with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification,Jennifer L. Hoffman,"  While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the
presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they
are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line
profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness.
We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric
characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination
angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like
emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around
all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations
between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us
address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility
of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.

"Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary, A0620-00","C.S. Froning, E.L. Robinson, and M.A. Bitner","  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF.
The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of
neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with
previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.
(1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH =
9.7+-0.6 M_solar.

Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits,"Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel, John Kubiatowicz","  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with
automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for
quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance
variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement.
We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm
suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based
analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of
qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better
layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling
mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of
some area.

"Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A
  during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004",M. Joshi and M. Boettcher,"  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength
monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis
patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day
time scales.

"The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. X. A m sin i = 11
  Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674","X. Bonfils, M. Mayor, X. Delfosse, T. Forveille, M. Gillon, C.
  Perrier, S. Udry, F. Bouchy, C. Lovis, F. Pepe, D. Queloz, N. C. Santos and
  J.-L. Bertaux","  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of
planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

"A Comparison between Anomalous 6-cm H$_2$CO Absorption and CO(1-0)
  Emission in the L1204/S140","Monica Ivette Rodriguez, Tommy Wiklind, Ronald J. Allen, Vladimir
  Escalante, and Laurent Loinard","  We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescope
in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includes
the
  S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against
the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm
molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO
and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant
differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than
the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily
photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas
located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions.

Dimers on surface graphs and spin structures. II,"David Cimasoni, Nicolai Reshetikhin","  In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a
graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete
spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric
proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on
G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact
oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and
gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition
function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum
field theory on surface graphs.

Mapping radii of metric spaces,George M. Bergman (U.C.Berkeley),"  It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can be
surrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting S
denote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we here
express this fact by saying that the ""mapping radius"" of S in R^n is 1.
  Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in
a metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space,
the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric
spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear
combinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X).
  Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted.

A New Model For The Loop-I (The North Polar Spur) Region,M. Wolleben,"  The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large
circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting
of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale
structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of
the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes
close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles.
It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by
interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of
the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested.

Leray numbers of projections and a topological Helly type theorem,Gil Kalai and Roy Meshulam,"  Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray number
L(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of any

simplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimage
of any point in |Y| is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1.
One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta.

HI velocity dispersion in NGC 1058,A. O. Petric and M. P. Rupen,"  We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA)
observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058,
providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the
entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture
of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range
between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the
gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this
global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved
regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much
steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas
motions.
"
Common Envelope Evolution Redux,Ronald F. Webbink (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign),"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the
envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

This system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer is
electron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers are
essentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle
properties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square
root field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows
quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may
persists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated
graphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial
graphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized
states in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using
standard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of

"Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions
  of the thermodynamic model","G. Chaudhuri, S. Das Gupta","  We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly.
Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen in
predictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclear
system passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are able
to pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when
they appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics
addressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in
the canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand
canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the
issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in
both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this
distribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The
relationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed.

With decreasing J/T, vortices appear in the system in ever greater numbers. We
confirm thermal activation as the vortex formation mechanism and obtain
information on the size of bound vortex pairs as J/T is varied.

The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations,"Jarrod R. Hurley, Sverre J. Aarseth, Michael M. Shara","  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using
N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these
models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial
binary content of globular clusters.

Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser,"M. Jeppesen, J. Dugu\'e, G. R. Dennis, M. T. Johnsson, C. Figl, N. P.
  Robins and J. D. Close","  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam
quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman
transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman
outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on
the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom
laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments
with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom
lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the
condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg
limit.
"
A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm,Gavin P. Salam and Gregory Soyez,"  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event
particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.

"Isospin breaking in the yield of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation
  near threshold","S. Dubynskiy, A. Le Yaouanc, L. Oliver, J.-C. Raynal and M.B. Voloshin","  We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb
interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar
D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We
consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin
I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We
find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering
phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar
K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the
charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases
in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the
same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference
between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering
effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of
this mass difference.

  For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of

\pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C =
C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of
definable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some
$\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z,
\z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $
while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C
\cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting,
bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and
semi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the above
results, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independent
interest in the study of arrangements.

"Generalized Twistor Transform And Dualities, With A New Description of
  Particles With Spin, Beyond Free and Massless",Itzhak Bars and Bora Orcal,"  A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is
constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping
them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations
among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not
equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these
systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of
twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical
applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.
Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A
unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in
the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the
dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in
high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as
well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper
we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details.

Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger,"Sung-Chul Yoon, Philipp Podsiadlowski and Stephan Rosswog","  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen
(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

connection between the smoothness degree of a vector $x\in X$ with respect to
the operator A, the order of convergence to zero of the best approximation of x

Parametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity,Stephon Alexander and Nicolas Yunes,"  We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of
the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In
particular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized
post-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN
parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general
relativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is
proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN
vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the
non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By
mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the
corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point
particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that
the Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by
current and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of
Chern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory.

"Scaling of Resistance and Electron Mean Free Path of Single-Walled
  Carbon Nanotubes","Meninder Purewal, Byung Hee Hong, Anirudhh Ravi, Bhupesh Chandra,
  James Hone, and Philip Kim","  We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in
individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary
four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is
obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various
temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity
scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with
increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon
scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been
experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at
extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects.

Differential Recursion and Differentially Algebraic Functions,Akitoshi Kawamura,"  Moore introduced a class of real-valued ""recursive"" functions by analogy with
Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise
definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains
some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his ""primitive recursive"" functions,
we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the
ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on
partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to
differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog
computation, fails.

Spline Single-Index Prediction Model,Li Wang and Lijian Yang,"  For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection
pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high
dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly
dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which
is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is
identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of
the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a
genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for
the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent
and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is
sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within
seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates
with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive
flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.

"Measurement of the Aerosol Phase Function at the Pierre Auger
  Observatory","S.Y. BenZvi, B.M. Connolly, J.A.J. Matthews, M. Prouza, E.F. Visbal,
  S. Westerhoff","  Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic
rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the
extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the
light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only
attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component
due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction
requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol
phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given
direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase
function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)
light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of
the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image
of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the
design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

The World as Evolving Information,Carlos Gershenson,"  This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,
especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.

"Polymerization Force Driven Buckling of Microtubule Bundles Determines
  the Wavelength of Patterns Formed in Tubulin Solutions","Yongxing Guo, Yifeng Liu, Jay X. Tang, and James M. Valles Jr","  We present a model for the spontaneous formation of a striated pattern in
polymerizing microtubule solutions. It describes the buckling of a single
microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly
aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization
microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the
polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional
force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity
curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT
bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis
implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.

"Neutron Inelastic Scattering Processes as Background for Double-Beta
  Decay Experiments","D.-M. Mei, S.R. Elliott, A. Hime, V. Gehman and K. Kazkaz","  We investigate several Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) and Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions. We
measure $\gamma$-ray production from Pb$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions that can be a
significant background for double-beta decay experiments which use lead as a
massive inner shield. Particularly worrisome for Ge-based double-beta decay
experiments are the 2041-keV and 3062-keV $\gamma$ rays produced via
Pb$(n,n'\gamma$). The former is very close to the ^{76}Ge double-beta decay
endpoint energy and the latter has a double escape peak energy near the
endpoint. Excitation $\gamma$-ray lines from Ge$(n,n'\gamma$) reactions are
also observed. We consider the contribution of such backgrounds and their
impact on the sensitivity of next-generation searches for neutrinoless
double-beta decay using enriched germanium detectors.

Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E,"Eric L. N. Jensen (1), Saurav Dhital (1,2), Keivan G. Stassun (2),

  (5), Gibor Basri (6); (1 - Swarthmore College; 2 - Vanderbilt; 3 - Caltech; 4
  - Wesleyan University; 5 - SUNY Stony Brook; 6 - UC Berkeley)","  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in
their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.
"
Effect of node deleting on network structure,"Ke Deng, Heping Zhao, Dejun Li","  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks
has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

The Complexity of HCP in Digraps with Degree Bound Two,Guohun Zhu,"  The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two is
solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an
incidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced
bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of
G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and
finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian
digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP base
on the results.

"VLBI observations of nineteen GHz-Peaked-Spectrum radio sources at 1.6
  GHz","Xiang Liu, Lang Cui, Wen-Feng Luo, Wei-Zhao Shi, Hua-Gang Song (Urumqi
  Observatory, NAOC)","  Aims and Methods: We present the results of VLBI observations of nineteen
GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources at 1.6 GHz. Of them, 15 sources are
selected from the Parkes Half Jansky (PHJ) sample (Snellen 2002), 4 others are
from our previous observation list. We aimed at imaging the structure of GPS
sources, searching for Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) and studying the
absorption for the convex radio spectra of GPS sources.
  Results: We obtained total intensity 1.6 GHz VLBI images of 17 sources for
the first time. Of them, 80% show mini-double-lobe radio structure, indicating
that they are CSOs or candidates, and their host AGNs could be edge-on to us.
This result suggests that there is a high incidence of mini double-lobe sources
(or CSOs) in the PHJ sample. The sources J0323+0534, J1135-0021, J1352+0232,
J2058+0540, J2123-0112 and J2325-0344 with measured redshift, showing
double-lobe structure with sizes of <1 kpc, are classified as CSOs. Three

Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes,"John R. Kirtley, Zhifeng Deng, Lan Luan, Erhan Yenilmez, Hongjie Dai,
  and Kathryn A. Moler","  A recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force
microscopy (MFM) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of
conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic
layer. Magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these
tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions. Here we
demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the
moment direction of the nanotube tip. This results in a signal which is
proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in MFM. Our
modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in
the observed switching, and that it should be possible to image very high bit
densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors.

necessary for next generation cosmological mass probes. Our matching procedure
reproduces the CMB distance to last scattering and delivers subpercent level
power spectra at z=0 and z~3. We discuss the physical implications for probing
dark energy with surveys of large scale structure.

Possibility of Gapless Spin Liquid State by One-dimensionalization,"Yuta Hayashi, Masao Ogata","  Motivated by the observation of a gapless spin liquid state in
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, we analyze the anisotropic triangular
lattice $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model with the resonating valence bond mean-field
approximation. Paying attention to the small quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy
of the material, we take an approach from one-dimensional (1D) chains coupled
with frustrating zig-zag bonds. By calculating one-particle excitation spectra
changing anisotropy parameter $J'/J$ from the decoupled 1D chains to the
isotropic triangular lattice, we find almost gapless excitations in the wide
range from the 1D limit. This one-dimensionalization by frustration is
considered to be a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid
state.

Extra dimensions and Lorentz invariance violation,"Viktor Baukh, Alexander Zhuk, Tina Kahniashvili","  We consider effective model where photons interact with scalar field
corresponding to conformal excitations of the internal space (geometrical

modified dispersion relation for photons, and consequently, the photon group
velocity depends on the energy implying the propagation time delay effect. We
suggest to use the experimental bounds of the time delay of gamma ray bursts
(GRBs) photons propagation as an additional constrain for the gravexciton
parameters.

"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass
  function in early- and late-type galaxies","Alister W. Graham, Simon P. Driver, Paul D. Allen, Jochen Liske","  We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function
using (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the
Sersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured
(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy
Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct
measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for
both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it
straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type
galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function
with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the
galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive
black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.
That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)
h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in
supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

Complete Shrinking Ricci Solitons have Finite Fundamental Group,William Wylie,"  We show that if a complete Riemannian manifold supports a vector field such
that the Ricci tensor plus the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to the
vector field has a positive lower bound, then the fundamental group is finite.
In particular, it follows that complete shrinking Ricci solitons and complete
smooth metric measure spaces with a positive lower bound on the Bakry-Emery
tensor have finite fundamental group. The method of proof is to generalize
arguments of Garcia-Rio and Fernandez-Lopez in the compact case.

Effects of Dirac sea on pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter,Subhrajyoti Biswas and Abhee K. Dutt-Mazumder,"  We study pion propagation in asymmetric nuclear matter (ANM). One of the
interesting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for
the different charged states of pions. First we describe the pion-nucleon
dynamics using the non-chiral model where one starts with pseudoscalar (PS)
$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via
suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect
of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the
chiral effective Lagrangian where the short-distance behavior (Dirac vacuum) is
included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective
field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the
previous calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed
form analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and
dispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and
suitable density expansion.

"Spin-orbit coupling effect on the persistent currents in mesoscopic ring
  with an Anderson impurity",Guo-Hui Ding and Bing Dong,"  Based on the finite $U$ slave boson method, we have investigated the effect
of Rashba spin-orbit(SO) coupling on the persistent charge and spin currents in
mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. It is shown that the Kondo effect
will decrease the magnitude of the persistent charge and spin currents in this
side-coupled Anderson impurity case. In the presence of SO coupling, the
persistent currents change drastically and oscillate with the strength of SO
coupling. The SO coupling will suppress the Kondo effect and restore the abrupt
jumps of the persistent currents. It is also found that a persistent spin
current circulating the ring can exist even without the charge current in this
system.

Probability distributions generated by fractional diffusion equations,"Francesco Mainardi, Paolo Paradisi and Rudolf Gorenflo","  Fractional calculus allows one to generalize the linear, one-dimensional,
diffusion equation by replacing either the first time derivative or the second
space derivative by a derivative of fractional order. The fundamental solutions
of these equations provide probability density functions, evolving on time or
variable in space, which are related to the class of stable distributions. This
property is a noteworthy generalization of what happens for the standard
diffusion equation and can be relevant in treating financial and economical
problems where the stable probability distributions play a key role.

Fabrication of half metallicity in a ferromagnetic metal,Kalobaran Maiti,"  We investigate the growth of half metallic phase in a ferromagnetic material
using state-of-the-art full potential linearized augmented plane wave method.
To address the issue, we have substituted Ti at the Ru-sites in SrRuO3, where
SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence
states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti
substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.
This study, thus, provides a novel but simple way to fabricate half-metallicity
in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based
technology.

J. Control. Optim. \textbf{46}, 775-791 (2007)] shown that the minimal
spatially extended reaction-diffusion model of phytoplankton-zooplankton can
exhibit both regular, chaotic behavior, and spatiotemporal patterns in a patchy
environment. Based on that, the spatial plankton model is furtherly
investigated by means of computer simulations and theoretical analysis in the
present paper when its parameters would be expected in the case of mixed
Turing-Hopf bifurcation region. Our results show that the spiral waves exist in
that region and the spatiotemporal chaos emerge, which arise from the far-field
breakup of the spiral waves over large ranges of diffusion coefficients of
phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from
the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole
space within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation
spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains. Finally, we give some
explanations about the spatially structured patterns from the community level.

On the pseudospectrum of elliptic quadratic differential operators,Karel Pravda-Starov,"  We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non-selfadjoint differential
operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties,
which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under
small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of
elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators
defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.
We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the
Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.
When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral
instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which
can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description
of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some
numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from
their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.

"Fluctuation-dissipation relation on a Melde string in a turbulent flow,
  considerations on a ""dynamical temperature""","Vincent Grenard (Phys-ENS), Nicolas Garnier (Phys-ENS), Antoine Naert
  (Phys-ENS)","  We report on measurements of the transverse fluctuations of a string in a
turbulent air jet flow. Harmonic modes are excited by the fluctuating drag
force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it
possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over
space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the
dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the
fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate
the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare
our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the
theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the
spectrum of the fluctuations. This simple model and our experimental results
are in good agreement, over the range of wave-numbers, and Reynolds number
accessible ($74000 \leq Re \leq 170000$).

On generalized entropy measures and pathways,"A.M. Mathai, H.J. Haubold","  Product probability property, known in the literature as statistical
independence, is examined first. Then generalized entropies are introduced, all
of which give generalizations to Shannon entropy. It is shown that the nature
of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy
leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related
differential equations. Connection of Mathai's entropy to Kerridge's measure of
""inaccuracy"" is also explored.

Evolution of a band insulating phase from a correlated metallic phase,"Kalobaran Maiti, Ravi Shankar Singh, V.R.R. Medicherla","  We investigate the evolution of the electronic structure in SrRu_(1-x)Ti_xO_3

SrRuO3 is a weakly correlated metal and SrTiO3 is a band insulator. The surface
spectra exhibit a metal-insulator transition at x = 0.5 by opening up a soft

properties. In contrast, the bulk spectra reveal a pseudogap at the Fermi
level, and unusual evolution exhibiting an apparent broadening of the coherent
feature and subsequent decrease in intensity of the lower Hubbard band with the
increase in x. Interestingly, the first principle approaches are found to be
sufficient to capture anomalous evolutions at high energy scale. Analysis of
the spectral lineshape indicates strong interplay between disorder and electron
correlation in the electronic properties of this system.

Electroweak phase transitions in the MSSM with an extra $U(1)'$,"S.W. Ham, E.J. Yoo, S.K. OH","  We investigate the possibility of electroweak phase transition in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with an extra $U(1)'$. This model has two
Higgs doublets and a singlet, in addition to a singlet exotic quark superfield.
We find that at the one-loop level this model may accommodate the electroweak
phase transitions that are strongly first-order in a reasonably large region of
the parameter space. In the parameter region where the phase transitions take
place, we observe that the lightest scalar Higgs boson has a smaller mass when
the strength of the phase transition becomes weaker. Also, the other three
heavier neutral Higgs bosons get more large masses when the strength of the
phase transition becomes weaker.

"Solutions of fractional reaction-diffusion equations in terms of the
  H-function","H.J. Haubold, A.M. Mathai, R.K. Saxena","  This paper deals with the investigation of the solution of an unified
fractional reaction-diffusion equation associated with the Caputo derivative as
the time-derivative and Riesz-Feller fractional derivative as the
space-derivative. The solution is derived by the application of the Laplace and
Fourier transforms in closed form in terms of the H-function. The results
derived are of general nature and include the results investigated earlier by
many authors, notably by Mainardi et al. (2001, 2005) for the fundamental
solution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation, and Saxena et al.
(2006a, b) for fractional reaction- diffusion equations. The advantage of using
Riesz-Feller derivative lies in the fact that the solution of the fractional
reaction-diffusion equation containing this derivative includes the fundamental
solution for space-time fractional diffusion, which itself is a generalization
of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and
time-fractional diffusion. These specialized types of diffusion can be
interpreted as spatial probability density functions evolving in time and are
expressible in terms of the H-functions in compact form.

Random Matrix Theory at Nonzero $\mu$ and $T$,K. Splittorff and J.J.M. Verbaarschot,"  We review applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperature
and chemical potential. The chiral phase transition of QCD and QCD-like
theories is discussed in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. We show
that for QCD at $\mu \ne 0$, which has a sign problem, the discontinuity in the
chiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher relation. The
severity of the sign problem is analyzed in the microscopic domain of QCD.

"The effect of a fifth large-scale space-time dimension on the
  conservation of energy in a four dimensional Universe",M.B. Gerrard and T.J. Sumner,"  The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the
equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.
The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the
speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

many features of the optical conductivity in this compounds in terms of
magnetic/lattice polaron formation.

a dual descriptor derived by Toro-Labbe and coworkers (Morell, C.; Grand, A.;
Toro-Labbe, A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205), we propose a multiphilic

electrophilic (Wk-) condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable
of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the
given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the
path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor
has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions.
Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases.
Also, to study the intra- and intermolecular reactivities another related

the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all-metal aromatic

"Approximation of the distribution of a stationary Markov process with

R^d-valued c\`adl\`ag functions on R_+ in order to approximate the law of a

results of convergence of this sequence. Then, we apply them to Brownian
diffusions and solutions to L\'evy driven SDE's under some Lyapunov-type
stability assumptions. As a numerical application of this work, we show that
this procedure gives an efficient way of option pricing in stochastic
volatility models.

Influence of Phonon dimensionality on Electron Energy Relaxation,J. T. Karvonen and I. J. Maasilta,"  We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on
electron-phonon (e-p) interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on
suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub-Kelvin
temperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using
sensitive normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) tunnel junction
thermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to
clearly see the onset of the effects of two-dimensional (2D) phonon system. We
observed for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes the
temperature dependence and strength of the e-p scattering rate, with the
interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below $\sim$ 0.5 K for
the 30 nm membranes.

Bursting Dynamics of the 3D Euler Equations in Cylindrical Domains,"Fran\c{c}ois Golse (CMLS-EcolePolytechnique, LJLL), Alex Mahalov,
  Basil Nicolaenko","  A class of three-dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large
vorticity is considered for the Euler equations of incompressible fluids. The
fast singular oscillating limits of the Euler equations are studied for
parametrically resonant cylinders. Resonances of fast swirling Beltrami waves
deplete the Euler nonlinearity. The resonant Euler equations are systems of
three-dimensional rigid body equations, coupled or not. Some cases of these
resonant systems have homoclinic cycles, and orbits in the vicinity of these
homoclinic cycles lead to bursts of the Euler solution measured in Sobolev
norms of order higher than that corresponding to the enstrophy.

"Synergistic Effects of MoDTC and ZDTP on Frictional Behaviour of
  Tribofilms at the Nanometer Scale","Sandrine Bec (LTDS), Andr\'e Tonck (LTDS), Jean-Marie Georges (LTDS),
  Glyn W. Roper (SHELL)","  The layered structure and the rheological properties of anti-wear films,
generated in a rolling/sliding contact from lubricants containing zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDTP) and/or molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC)
additives, have been studied by dynamic nanoindentation experiments coupled
with a simple modelling of the stiffness measurements. Local nano-friction
experiments were conducted with the same device in order to determine the
evolution of the friction coefficient as a function of the applied pressure for
the different lubricant formulations. For the MoDTC film, the applied pressure
in the friction test remains low (<0.5 GPa) and the apparent friction
coefficient is high ($\mu$ > 0.4). For the tribofilms containing MoDTC together
with ZDTP, which permits the applied pressure to increase up to a few GPa
through some accommodation process, a very low friction domain appears (0.01 <
$\mu$ < 0.05), located a few nanometers below the surface of the tribofilm.
This low friction coefficient is attributed to the presence of MoS2 planes
sliding over each other in a favourable configuration obtained when the
pressure is sufficiently high, which is made possible by the presence of ZDTP.

"Lattice Boltzmann inverse kinetic approach for the incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations","Enrico Fonda, Massimo Tessarotto and Marco Ellero","  In spite of the large number of papers appeared in the past which are devoted
to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.
"
Phonon-mediated decay of an atom in a surface-induced potential,"Fam Le Kien, S. Dutta Gupta, and K. Hakuta","  We study phonon-mediated transitions between translational levels of an atom
in a surface-induced potential. We present a general master equation governing
the dynamics of the translational states of the atom. In the framework of the
Debye model, we derive compact expressions for the rates for both upward and
downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are
performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of
bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate
is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep
bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.
Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of
magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.
We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400
$\mu$K in the vicinity of a silica surface with temperature of 300 K, the
adsorption (free-to-bound decay) rate is about two times larger than the
heating (free-to-free upward decay) rate, while the cooling (free-to-free
downward decay) rate is negligible.

Cofibrations in the Category of Frolicher Spaces. Part I,B. Dugmore and PP. Ntumba,"  Cofibrations are defined in the category of Fr\""olicher spaces by weakening
the analog of the classical definition to enable smooth homotopy extensions to
be more easily constructed, using flattened unit intervals. We later relate
smooth cofibrations to smooth neighborhood deformation retracts. The notion of
smooth neighborhood deformation retract gives rise to an analogous result that
a closed Fr\""olicher subspace $A$ of the Fr\""olicher space $X$ is a smooth
neighborhood deformation retract of $X$ if and only if the inclusion $i:
A\hookrightarrow X$ comes from a certain subclass of cofibrations. As an
application we construct the right Puppe sequence.

"Experimental observation of structural crossover in binary mixtures of

  and Clemens Bechinger","  Using confocal-microscopy we investigate the structure of binary mixtures of
colloidal hard spheres with size ratio q=0.61. As a function of the packing
fraction of the two particle species, we observe a marked change of the
dominant wavelength in the pair correlation function. This behavior is in
excellent agreement with a recently predicted structural crossover in such
mixtures. In addition, the repercussions of structural crossover on the
real-space structure of a binary fluid are analyzed. We suggest a relation
between crossover and the lateral extension of networks containing only equally
sized particles that are connected by nearest neighbor bonds. This is supported
by Monte-Carlo simulations which are performed at different packing fractions
and size ratios.

A High Robustness and Low Cost Model for Cascading Failures,"Bing Wang, Beom Jun Kim","  We study numerically the cascading failure problem by using artificially
created scale-free networks and the real network structure of the power grid.
The capacity for a vertex is assigned as a monotonically increasing function of
the load (or the betweenness centrality). Through the use of a simple
functional form with two free parameters, revealed is that it is indeed
possible to make networks more robust while spending less cost. We suggest that
our method to prevent cascade by protecting less vertices is particularly
important for the design of more robust real-world networks to cascading
failures.

Diffuse X-ray Emission from the Carina Nebula Observed with Suzaku,"Kenji Hamaguchi, the Suzaku Eta Carinae team and the Carinae D-1 team","  A number of giant HII regions are associated with soft diffuse X-ray
emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse
emission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by
collisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O
stars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from
massive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.
  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for
extended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key
emission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side
of the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra
of the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines
of iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core
these lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal
plasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3
abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might
originate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.

The Colin de Verdi\`ere number and graphs of polytopes,Ivan Izmestiev,"  The Colin de Verdi\`ere number $\mu(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum corank
of a Colin de Verdi\`ere matrix for $G$ (that is, of a Schr\""odinger operator
on $G$ with a single negative eigenvalue). In 2001, Lov\'asz gave a
construction that associated to every convex 3-polytope a Colin de Verdi\`ere
matrix of corank 3 for its 1-skeleton.
  We generalize the Lov\'asz construction to higher dimensions by interpreting
it as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary,
$\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope.
  Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on the
second Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes and on Bol's condition for
equality.

"Visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of Jupiter Trojans: final
  results on dynamical families","S. Fornasier, E. Dotto, O. Hainaut, F. Marzari, H. Boehnhardt, F. De
  Luise, M. A. Barucci","  We present the results of a visible spectroscopic and photometric survey of
Jupiter Trojans belonging to different dynamical families carried out at the
ESO-NTT telescope. We obtained data on 47 objects, 23 belonging to the L5 swarm
and 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by
Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of
visible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six
families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5
cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The
sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception
of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and
P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the
exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is
detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type
asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property
distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in
comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.
Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher
inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.

  Milliarcsecond-scale morphology of CSS objects","Magdalena Kunert-Bajraszewska (1), Andrzej Marecki (1),((1) Torun
  Centre for Astronomy, N. Copernicus University, Torun)","  Multifrequency VLBA observations of the final group of ten objects in a
sample of FIRST-based compact steep spectrum (CSS) sources are presented. The
sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics
of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or
possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made
using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,
5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are
presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of
the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a
complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One
of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and
infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object
whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The
young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution
scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux
of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.

by their durations and amplitudes on vortex system of isotropic
high-temperature superconductors system HoBa2Cu3O7-d showed the presence of
threshold phenomena. The small duration pulses does not change the course of
relaxation processes taking place in vortex matter. When the duration of pulses

"Spin and pseudospin symmetries and the equivalent spectra of
  relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles","P. Alberto, A. S. de Castro, M. Malheiro","  We show that the conditions which originate the spin and pseudospin
symmetries in the Dirac equation are the same that produce equivalent energy
spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector
and scalar potentials. The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapes
of the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. When
both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for
isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper
component or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making it
equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,
besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular
momentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper or
lower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle. We point out a few
possible applications of this result.

"General asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations and phase
  transitions in quantum gravity",D. Podolsky,"  We discuss generic properties of classical and quantum theories of gravity
with a scalar field which are revealed at the vicinity of the cosmological
singularity. When the potential of the scalar field is exponential and
unbounded from below, the general solution of the Einstein equations has
quasi-isotropic asymptotics near the singularity instead of the usual
anisotropic Belinskii - Khalatnikov - Lifshitz (BKL) asymptotics. Depending on
the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum
gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field
correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with
quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is
interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.

Trigonometric parallaxes of high velocity halo white dwarf candidates,"C. Ducourant, R. Teixeira, N.C. Hambly, B. R. Oppenheimer, M.R.S.
  Hawkins, M. Rapaport, J. Modolo, J.F. Lecampion","  The status of 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by Oppenheimer et al.
(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses
undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

AMR simulations of the low T/|W| bar-mode instability of neutron stars,"Pablo Cerd\'a-Dur\'an, Vicent Quilis, Jos\'e A. Font","  It has been recently argued through numerical work that rotating stars with a
high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode
deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications
for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable
amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.

Evolutionary games on minimally structured populations,Gergely J Szollosi and Imre Derenyi,"  Population structure induced by both spatial embedding and more general
networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

Torsional oscillations of longitudinally inhomogeneous coronal loops,T.V. Zaqarashvili and K Murawski,"  We explore the effect of an inhomogeneous mass density field on frequencies
and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.
Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a
development of coronal seismology.

"Pseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo
  Codes","Ioannis Chatzigeorgiou, Miguel R. D. Rodrigues, Ian J. Wassell and
  Rolando Carrasco","  It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel
concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than
that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can
only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards
low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a
rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we
present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to
simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the
error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

The Arctic Circle Revisited,F. Colomo and A.G. Pronko,"  The problem of limit shapes in the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary
conditions is addressed by considering a specially tailored bulk correlation
function, the emptiness formation probability. A closed expression of this
correlation function is given, both in terms of certain determinant and
multiple integral, which allows for a systematic treatment of the limit shapes
of the model for full range of values of vertex weights. Specifically, we show
that for vertex weights corresponding to the free-fermion line on the phase
diagram, the emptiness formation probability is related to a one-matrix model
with a triple logarithmic singularity, or Triple Penner model. The saddle-point
analysis of this model leads to the Arctic Circle Theorem, and its
generalization to the Arctic Ellipses, known previously from domino tilings.

"Time and motion in physics: the Reciprocity Principle, relativistic
  invariance of the lengths of rulers and time dilatation",J.H.Field,"  Ponderable objects moving in free space according to Newton's First Law
constitute both rulers and clocks when one such object is viewed from the rest
frame of another. Together with the Reciprocity Principle this is used to
demonstrate, in both Galilean and special relativity, the invariance of the
measured length of a ruler in motion. The different times: `proper', `improper'
and `apparent' appearing in different formulations of the relativistic time
dilatation relation are discussed and exemplified by experimental applications.
A non-intuitive `length expansion' effect predicted by the Reciprocity
Principle as a necessary consequence of time dilatation is pointed out

B --> rho K* decays and other rare vector-vector modes,G. Vasseur,"  The recent analyses of the following rare vector-vector decays of the B meson
are presented: rho K*, omega K*, omega rho, omega omega, and omega phi
charmless final states. The latest results indicate that the fraction of
longitudinal polarization is about 0.5 in penguin-dominated modes and close to
1 for tree-dominated modes.

Extending the theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in quasi-2D,J.P.Hague,"  I present results from an extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory of
electron-phonon interactions and superconductivity. The history of the
electron-phonon problem is introduced, and then study of the intermediate
parameter regime is justified from the energy scales in the cuprate
superconductors. The Holstein model is detailed, and limiting cases are
examined to demonstrate the need for an extended theory of superconductivity.
Results of the extended approximation are shown, including spectral functions
and phase diagrams. These are discussed with reference to Hohenberg's theorem,
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and Coulomb repulsion.

Generalized Nariai Solutions for Yang-type Monopoles,"Pablo Diaz, Antonio Segui","  A detailed study of the geometries that emerge by a gravitating generalized
Yang monopole in even dimensions is carried out. In particular, those which
present black hole and cosmological horizons. This two-horizon system is
thermally unstable. The process of thermalization will drive both horizons to
coalesce. This limit is what is profusely studied in this paper. It is shown
that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does
not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and
identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new
spacetime are then calculated. Topics, as the elliptical relation between radii
of spheres in the geometry or a discussion about whether a mass-type term
should be present in the line element or not, are also included.

"Instanton representation of Plebanski gravity. Consistency of the
  initital value constraints under time evolution",Eyo Eyo Ita III,"  The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity provides as equations of
motion a Hodge self-duality condition and a set of `generalized' Maxwell's
equations, subject to gravitational degrees of freedom encoded in the initial
value constraints of general relativity. The main result of the present paper
will be to prove that this constraint surface is preserved under time
evolution. We carry this out not using the usual Dirac procedure, but rather
the Lagrangian equations of motion themsleves. Finally, we provide a comparison
with the Ashtekar formulation to place these results into overall context.

"Metal-insulator transition in the low-dimensional organic conductor
  (TMTSF)2FSO3 probed by infrared microspectroscopy","A. Pashkin, K. Thirunavukkuarasu, Y.-L. Mathis, W. Kang, and C. A.
  Kuntscher","  We present measurements of the infrared response of the quasi-one-dimensional
organic conductor (TMTSF)2$SO3 along (E||a) and perpendicular (E||b') to the
stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator
transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show
a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1
(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the
optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations
gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the
transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the
lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new
infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which
has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a
metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between
the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment
of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of
the new mode.

"The effect of Topcolor Assisted Technicolor, and other models, on
  Neutrino Oscillation","Minako Honda, Yee Kao, Naotoshi Okamura, Alexey Pronin, and Tatsu
  Takeuchi","  New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on
neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three
flavors of neutrino. In Ref.1, we argued that a long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its high-energy mode
is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be capable of
constraining the size of those extra matter effects, provided the vacuum value
of \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this talk, we discuss how
such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and
masses of new particles in models such as topcolor assisted technicolor.

"Shaped angular dependence of the spin transfer torque and microwave
  generation without magnetic field","O. Boulle, V. Cros, J. Grollier, L. G. Pereira, C. Deranlot, F.
  Petroff, G. Faini, J. Barnas, A. Fert","  The generation of oscillations in the microwave frequency range is one of the
most important applications expected from spintronics devices exploiting the
spin transfer phenomenon. We report transport and microwave power measurements
on specially designed nanopillars for which a non-standard angular dependence
of the spin transfer torque (wavy variation) is predicted by theoretical
models. We observe a new kind of current-induced dynamics that is characterized
by large angle precessions in the absence of any applied field, as this is also
predicted by simulation with such a wavy angular dependence of the torque. This
type of non-standard nanopillars can represent an interesting way for the
implementation of spin transfer oscillators since they are able to generate
microwave oscillations without applied magnetic field. We also emphasize the
theoretical implications of our results on the angular dependence of the
torque.

"Dark energy interacting with neutrinos and dark matter: a
  phenomenological theory",G. M. Kremer,"  A model for a flat homogeneous and isotropic Universe composed of dark
energy, dark matter, neutrinos, radiation and baryons is analyzed. The fields
of dark matter and neutrinos are supposed to interact with the dark energy. The
dark energy is considered to obey either the van der Waals or the Chaplygin
equations of state. The ratio between the pressure and the energy density of
the neutrinos varies with the red-shift simulating massive and non-relativistic
neutrinos at small red-shifts and non-massive relativistic neutrinos at high
red-shifts. The model can reproduce the expected red-shift behaviors of the
deceleration parameter and of the density parameters of each constituent.

"Levy-Lieb constrained-search formulation as a minimization of the

the exact Hohenberg-Kohn functional for any N-representable electron density,

functional with respect to the N-1 conditional probability density, where N is
number of electrons of the system. The consequences and implications of such a
result are here analyzed and discussed via a practical example.

"Reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound
  states","Utpal Roy, Suranjana Ghosh, T. Shreecharan, and Kaushik Bhattacharya","  In quantum mechanics textbooks the momentum operator is defined in the
Cartesian coordinates and rarely the form of the momentum operator in spherical
polar coordinates is discussed. Consequently one always generalizes the
Cartesian prescription to other coordinates and falls in a trap. In this work
we introduce the difficulties one faces when the question of the momentum
operator in spherical polar coordinate comes. We have tried to point out most
of the elementary quantum mechanical results, related to the momentum operator,
which has coordinate dependence. We explicitly calculate the momentum
expectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value
really turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum
expectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular
variables in quantum mechanics and the problems related in interpreting them as
dynamical variables. At the end, we calculate the Heisenberg's equation of
motion for the radial component of the momentum for the Hydrogen atom.

"Rich methane premixed laminar flames doped by light unsaturated
  hydrocarbons - Part I : allene and propyne","Hadj-Ali Gueniche (DCPR), Pierre-Alexandre Glaude (DCPR), Guillaume
  Dayma (DCPR), Ren\'e Fournet (DCPR), Fr\'ed\'erique Battin-Leclerc (DCPR)","  The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a
pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne,
respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane
and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure
methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to
a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have
been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,
with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration
profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling
with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and
dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne,
allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene,
1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a
PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from
700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results,
some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our
laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main
reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6
aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.

Environmental noise reduction for holonomic quantum gates,"Daniele Parodi, Maura Sassetti, Paolo Solinas, Nino Zangh\`i","  We study the performance of holonomic quantum gates, driven by lasers, under
the effect of a dissipative environment modeled as a thermal bath of
oscillators. We show how to enhance the performance of the gates by suitable
choice of the loop in the manifold of the controllable parameters of the laser.
For a simplified, albeit realistic model, we find the surprising result that
for a long time evolution the performance of the gate (properly estimated in
terms of average fidelity) increases. On the basis of this result, we compare
holonomic gates with the so-called stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
gates.

The lifetime of unstable particles in electromagnetic fields,"Daniele Binosi (ECT*, Trento), Vladimir Pascalutsa (ECT*, Trento &
  Mainz U.)","  We show that the electromagnetic moments of unstable particles (resonances)
have an absorptive contribution which quantifies the change of the particle's
lifetime in an external electromagnetic field. To give an example we compute
here the imaginary part of the magnetic moment for the cases of the muon and
the neutron at leading order in the electroweak coupling. We also consider an
analogous effect for the strongly-decaying $\Delta$(1232) resonance. The result
for the muon is Im$ \mu = e G_F^2 m^3/768 \pi^3$, with $e$ the charge and $m$
the mass of the muon, $G_F$ the Fermi constant, which in an external magnetic
field of $B$ Tesla give rise to the relative change in the muon lifetime of
$3\times 10^{-15} B$. For neutron the effect is of a similar magnitude. We
speculate on the observable implications of this effect.

"An equilibrium problem for the limiting eigenvalue distribution of
  banded Toeplitz matrices",Maurice Duits and Arno B.J. Kuijlaars,"  We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $n\times n$ banded Toeplitz
matrices as $n\to \infty$. From classical results of Schmidt-Spitzer and
Hirschman it is known that the eigenvalues accumulate on a special curve in the
complex plane and the normalized eigenvalue counting measure converges weakly
to a measure on this curve as $n\to\infty$. In this paper, we characterize the
limiting measure in terms of an equilibrium problem. The limiting measure is
one component of the unique vector of measures that minimes an energy
functional defined on admissible vectors of measures. In addition, we show that
each of the other components is the limiting measure of the normalized counting
measure on certain generalized eigenvalues.

Exponential growth rates in a typed branching diffusion,"Y. Git, J. W. Harris, S. C. Harris","  We study the high temperature phase of a family of typed branching diffusions
initially studied in [Ast\'{e}risque 236 (1996) 133--154] and [Lecture Notes in
Math. 1729 (2000) 239--256 Springer, Berlin]. The primary aim is to establish
some almost-sure limit results for the long-term behavior of this particle
system, namely the speed at which the population of particles colonizes both
space and type dimensions, as well as the rate at which the population grows
within this asymptotic shape. Our approach will include identification of an
explicit two-phase mechanism by which particles can build up in sufficient
numbers with spatial positions near $-\gamma t$ and type positions near $\kappa
\sqrt{t}$ at large times $t$. The proofs involve the application of a variety
of martingale techniques--most importantly a ``spine'' construction involving a
change of measure with an additive martingale. In addition to the model's
intrinsic interest, the methodologies presented contain ideas that will adapt
to other branching settings. We also briefly discuss applications to traveling
wave solutions of an associated reaction--diffusion equation.

using accurate mass models appropriate to each case in order to ascertain the
maximum plausible collision velocity. Impact velocities consistent with the
shock velocity (~ 4700km/s) occur naturally in MOND. CDM can generate collision
velocities of at most ~ 3800km/s, and is only consistent with the data provided
that the shock velocity has been substantially enhanced by hydrodynamical
effects.
"
On Some Subgroup Chains Related to Kneser's Theorem,"Yahya Ould Hamidoune, Oriol Serra, Gilles Zemor","  A recent result of Balandraud shows that for every subset S of an abelian
group G, there exists a non trivial subgroup H such that |TS| <= |T|+|S|-2
holds only if the stabilizer of TS contains H. Notice that Kneser's Theorem
says only that the stabilizer of TS must be a non-zero subgroup.
  This strong form of Kneser's theorem follows from some nice properties of a
certain poset investigated by Balandraud. We consider an analogous poset for
nonabelian groups and, by using classical tools from Additive Number Theory,
extend some of the above results. In particular we obtain short proofs of
Balandraud's results in the abelian case.

"The Exact Boundary Condition to Solve the Schrodinger Equation of Many

electronic systems within the framework of fixed node approach, we derive the
exclusion principle ""Two electrons can't be at the same external isopotential
surface simultaneously"" using the first postulate of quantum mechanics. We
propose the exact Coulomb-Exchange nodal surface i.e. the exact boundary
condition to solve the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation for the
non-degenerate ground state of atoms and molecules. This boundary condition was
applied to compute the ground state energies of N, Ne, Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2,
O2, F2, and H2O systems using diffusion Monte Carlo method. The ground state
energies thus obtained agree well with the exact estimate of non-relativistic
energies.

  relativistic fragmentation","D. A. Artemenkov, T. V. Shchedrina, R. Stanoeva, and P. I. Zarubin","  Recent studies of clustering in light nuclei with an initial energy above 1 A
GeV in nuclear treack emulsion are overviewed. The results of investigations of
the relativistic $^9$Be nuclei fragmentation in emulsion, which entails the
production of He fragments, are presented. It is shown that most precise
angular measurements provided by this technique play a crucial role in the
restoration of the excitation spectrum of the $\alpha$ particle sysytem. In
peripheral interactions $^9$Be nuclei are dissociated practically totally
through the 0$^+$ and 2$^+$ states of the $^8$Be nucleus.
  The results of investigations of the dissociation of a $^{14}$N nucleus of
momentum 2.86 A GeV/c in emulsion are presented as example of more complicated
system. The momentum and correlation characteristics of $\alpha$ particles for
the $^{14}$N$\to3\alpha+X$ channel in the laboratory system and the rest
systems of 3$\alpha$ particles were considered in detail.
  Topology of charged fragments produced in peripheral relativistic
dissociation of radioactive $^8$B, $^7$Be nuclei in emulsion is studied.

Super-shell structures and pairing in ultracold trapped Fermi gases,M. Ogren and H. Heiselberg,"  We calculate level densities and pairing gaps for an ultracold dilute gas of
fermionic atoms in harmonic traps under the influence of mean field and
anharmonic quartic trap potentials. Super-shell structures, which were found in
Hartree-Fock calculations, are calculated analytically within periodic orbit
theory as well as from WKB calculations. For attractive interactions, the
underlying level densities are crucial for pairing and super-shell structures
in gaps are predicted.

Quantum non-local effects with Bose-Einstein condensates,"Franck Lalo\""e (LKB - Lhomond), William J. Mullin (UMASS)","  We study theoretically the properties of two Bose-Einstein condensates in
different spin states, represented by a double Fock state. Individual
measurements of the spins of the particles are performed in transverse
directions, giving access to the relative phase of the condensates. Initially,
this phase is completely undefined, and the first measurements provide random
results. But a fixed value of this phase rapidly emerges under the effect of
the successive quantum measurements, giving rise to a quasi-classical situation
where all spins have parallel transverse orientations. If the number of
measurements reaches its maximum (the number of particles), quantum effects
show up again, giving rise to violations of Bell type inequalities. The
violation of BCHSH inequalities with an arbitrarily large number of spins may
be comparable (or even equal) to that obtained with two spins.

  HD141272","T. Eisenbeiss, A. Seifahrt, M. Mugrauer, T.O.B. Schmidt, R.
  Neuhaeuser, T. Roell","  We search for stellar and substellar companions of young nearby stars to
investigate stellar multiplicity and formation of stellar and substellar
companions. We detect common proper-motion companions of stars via multi-epoch
imaging. Their companionship is finally confirmed with photometry and
spectroscopy. Here we report the discovery of a new co-moving (13 sigma)
stellar companion ~17.8 arcsec (350 AU in projected separation) north of the
nearby star HD141272 (21 pc). With EMMI/NTT optical spectroscopy we determined
the spectral type of the companion to be M3+-0.5V. The derived spectral type as
well as the near infrared photometry of the companion are both fully consistent
with a 0.26+-0.07 Msol dwarf located at the distance of HD141272 (21 pc).
Furthermore the photometry data rules out the pre-main sequence status, since
the system is consistent with the ZAMS of the Pleiades.

Sterile neutrinos at the CNGS,"A. Donini, M. Maltoni, D. Meloni, P. Migliozzi, F. Terranova","  We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space
of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an
$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this
mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on
$\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible
existence of sterile neutrinos.

"Evolution of the Carter constant for inspirals into a black hole: effect
  of the black hole quadrupole",Eanna E. Flanagan and Tanja Hinderer,"  We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits
around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

important role of the nuclear state is shown and methods of its calculation for
different regimes of optical excitation are proposed. The effect of spin echo
observed after application of the magnetic field $\pi$-pulse is predicted.

Simulation of Robustness against Lesions of Cortical Networks,"Marcus Kaiser, Robert Martin, Peter Andras and Malcolm P. Young","  Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain
will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many
properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to
their dynamics and even their evolution. Advances in the analysis of complex
networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and
functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks
recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random
(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that
have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,
hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network
analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and
macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark
rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis
strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and
connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free
networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck
connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.

A thermodynamic model for the melting of supported metal nanoparticles,S. C. Hendy,"  We construct a simple thermodynamic model to describe the melting of a
supported metal nanoparticle with a spherically curved free surface both with
and without surface melting. We use the model to investigate the results of
recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest the melting temperature of
a supported metal particle is the same as that of a free spherical particle
with the same surface curvature. Our model shows that this is only the case
when the contact angles of the supported solid and liquid particles are
similar. This is also the case for the temperature at which surface melting
begins.

unbounded. Using the vanishing discount factor approach, the optimality

"A Study of $B_{d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta^{(\prime)}$ Decays in the pQCD
  Approach","Xin Liu, Zhen-Jun Xiao, and Hui-Sheng Wang","  Motivated by the very recent measurement of the branching ratio of ${B_d^0}
\to J/\psi \eta$ decay, we calculate the branching ratios of ${B_d}^0 \to
J/\psi \eta$ and ${B_d}^0 \to J/\Psi \eta'$ decays in the perturbative QCD
(pQCD) approach. The pQCD predictions for the branching ratios of considered
decays are: $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta) = (1.96 ^{+9.68}_{-0.65}) \times
10^{-6}$, which is consistent with the first experimental measurement within
errors; while $BR(B_d^0 \to J/\Psi \eta') = (1.09 ^{+3.76}_{-0.25}) \times
10^{-6}$, very similar with $B_d^0 \to \jpsi \eta$ decay and can be tested by
the forthcoming LHC experiments. The measurements of these decay channels may
help us to understand the QCD dynamics in the corresponding energy scale,
especially the reliability of pQCD approach to these kinds of B meson decays.

Hubbard model with zero-point quantum fluctuations via Monte Carlo simulations
of quantum rotor model, and construct the corresponding phase diagram.
Compressibility shows a thermally activated gapped behavior in the insulating
regime. Finite-size scaling of the superfluid stiffness clearly shows the
nature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The transition temperature,
$T_c$, confirms a scaling relation $T_c \propto \rho_0^x$ with $x=1.0$. Some
evidences of anomalous quantum behavior at low temperatures are presented.

Conditional generation of path-entangled optical NOON states,Anne E. B. Nielsen and Klaus Molmer,"  We propose a measurement protocol to generate path-entangled NOON states

the protocol. The trigger detectors are assumed to have finite dead time, and
for short pulse trigger fields they are modeled as on/off detectors with finite
efficiency. Continuous-wave operation of the parametric oscillators is also
considered.

exponential rate in a distributional sense. This provides a probabilistic
explanation for the asymptotics of insertion depth in random trees generated by
a bit-comparison strategy from uniform input; we also obtain a representation
for the resulting family of limit laws along subsequences. Our approach can
also be used to obtain rates of convergence.

Hawking radiation of linear dilaton black holes,"G. Clement, J.C. Fabris and G.T. Marques","  We compute exactly the semi-classical radiation spectrum for a class of
non-asymptotically flat charged dilaton black holes, the so-called linear

black holes generically agrees with the surface gravity result. In the special
case where the black hole is massless, we show that, although the surface
gravity remains finite, there is no radiation, in agreement with the fact that
massless objects cannot radiate.

  M. Mouhcine, L.J. Smith, P.R. Wood, N. F\""orster Schreiber","  We report on recent progress in the modelling of the near-IR spectra of young
stellar populations, i.e. populations in which red supergiants (RSGs) are
dominant. First, we discuss the determination of fundamental parameters of RSGs
using fits to their near-IR spectra with new PHOENIX model spectra;
RSG-specific surface abundances are accounted for and effects of the
microturbulence parameter are explored. New population synthesis predictions
are then described and, as an example, it is shown that the spectra of young
star clusters in M82 can be reproduced very well from 0.5 to 2.4 micrometers.
We warn of remaining uncertainties in cluster ages.

"Locating the peaks of least-energy solutions to a quasilinear elliptic
  Neumann problem",Yi Li and Chunshan Zhao,"  In this paper we study the shape of least-energy solutions to a singularly
perturbed quasilinear problem with homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. We
use an intrinsic variation method to show that at limit, the global maximum
point of least-energy solutions goes to a point on the boundary faster than the
linear rate and this point on the boundary approaches to a point where the mean
curvature of the boundary achieves its maximum. We also give a complete proof
of exponential decay of least-energy solutions.

Review: Semiconductor Quantum Light Sources,Andrew J Shields,"  Lasers and LEDs display a statistical distribution in the number of photons
emitted in a given time interval. New applications exploiting the quantum
properties of light require sources for which either individual photons, or
pairs, are generated in a regulated stream. Here we review recent research on
single-photon sources based on the emission of a single semiconductor quantum
dot. In just a few years remarkable progress has been made in generating
indistinguishable single-photons and entangled photon pairs using such
structures. It suggests it may be possible to realise compact, robust, LED-like
semiconductor devices for quantum light generation.

"To the origin of the difference of FSI phases in $B\to\pi\pi$ and
  $B\to\rho\rho$ decays","A.B.Kaidalov, M.I.Vysotsky","  The final state interactions (FSI) model in which soft rescattering of low
mass intermediate states dominates is suggested. It explains why the strong
interaction phases are large in the $B_d\to\pi\pi$ channel and are considerably
smaller in the $B_d\to\rho\rho$ one. Direct CP asymmetries of $B_d\to\pi\pi$
decays which are determined by FSI phases are considered as well.

"An invariance principle for semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions
  in domains with piecewise smooth boundaries","W. Kang, R. J. Williams","  Semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions (SRBMs) living in the closures of
domains with piecewise smooth boundaries are of interest in applied probability
because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic
networks. In this paper, assuming certain conditions on the domains and
directions of reflection, a perturbation result, or invariance principle, for
SRBMs is proved. This provides sufficient conditions for a process that
satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in
convex polyhedrons with a constant reflection vector field on each face of the
polyhedron, and (ii) SRBMs in bounded domains with piecewise smooth boundaries
and possibly nonconstant reflection vector fields on the boundary surfaces.

Finite Drude weight for 1D low temperature conductors,Dariush Heidarian and Sandro Sorella,"  We apply well established finite temperature Quantum Monte Carlo techniques
to one dimensional Bose systems with soft and hardcore constraint, as well as
to spinless fermion systems. We give clear and robust numerical evidence that,
as expected, no superfluid density for Bosons or Meissner fraction for
fermions. is possible at {\em any} non zero temperature in one dimensional
interacting Bose or fermi lattice models, whereas a finite Drude weight is
generally observed in gapless systems, in partial disagreement to previous
expectations.

"Density dependent hadronic models and the relation between neutron stars
  and neutron skin thickness","S.S. Avancini, J.R. Marinelli, D.P. Menezes, M.M.W. de Moraes and C.
  Provid\^encia","  In the present work we investigate the main differences in the lead neutron
skin thickness, binding energy, surface energy and density profiles obtained
with two different density dependent relativistic hadronic models, within the
Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that the asymmetry parameter for low
momentum transfer polarized electron scattering is not sensitive to the model
parametrization differences.
"
Photoconductance of organic single-molecule contacts,"J. K. Viljas, F. Pauly and J. C. Cuevas","  We study the dc conductance of organic single-molecule contacts in the
presence of external electromagnetic radiation (photoconductance). In agreement
with previous predictions, we find that the radiation can lead to large
enhancements of the conductance of such contacts by bringing off-resonant
levels into resonance through photoassisted processes. In our analysis we make
use of the simplifying fact that, under certain assumptions, the
photoconductance can be expressed in terms of the transmission function in the
absence of the radiation. The conductance enhancement is demonstrated for
oligophenylene molecules between gold electrodes, whose electronic structure is
calculated based on density-functional theory. It is shown that the exponential
decay of the conductance with the length of the molecule can be replaced by a
length-independent value in the presence of radiation.

"On the over-barrier reflection in quantum mechanics with multiple
  degrees of freedom","D.G. Levkov, A.G. Panin, S.M. Sibiryakov","  We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system,
where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection
changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain
""optimal"" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger
probability than at other energies.

"Cyclotron Resonance study of the electron and hole velocity in graphene
  monolayers","R.S. Deacon, K-C. Chuang, R. J.Nicholas, K.S. Novoselov, A.K. Geim","  We report studies of cyclotron resonance in monolayer graphene. Cyclotron
resonance is detected using the photoconductive response of the sample for
several different Landau level occupancies. The experiments measure an electron
velocity at the K- (Dirac) point of $c_{K}^{*}$ = 1.093 x 10$^{6}$ ms$^{-1}$
and in addition detect a significant asymmetry between the electron and hole
bands, leading to a difference in the electron and hole velocities of 5% by
energies of 125 meV away from the Dirac point.

Molecular circuits based on graphene nano-ribbon junctions,Zhiping Xu,"  Graphene nano-ribbons junctions based electronic devices are proposed in this
Letter. Non-equilibrium Green function calculations show that nano-ribbon
junctions tailored from single layer graphene with different edge shape and
width can act as metal-semiconductor junctions and quantum dots can be
implemented. In virtue of the possibilities of patterning monolayer graphene
down to atomic precision, these structures, quite different from the previously
reported two-dimensional bulk graphene or carbon nanotube devices, are expected
to be used as the building blocks of the future nano-electronics.

"Unit groups of integral finite group rings with no noncyclic abelian
  finite subgroups",Martin Hertweck,"  It is shown that in the units of augmentation one of an integral group ring
$\mathbb{Z} G$ of a finite group $G$, a noncyclic subgroup of order $p^{2}$,
for some odd prime $p$, exists only if such a subgroup exists in $G$. The
corresponding statement for $p=2$ holds by the Brauer--Suzuki theorem, as
recently observed by W. Kimmerle.

Exotic Hadron in Pole-dominated QCD Sum Rules,"Toru Kojo, Daisuke Jido and Arata Hayashigaki","  We study pentaquark $\Theta^{+} (I=0,J=1/2)$ in the QCD sum rules emphasizing
that we can not extract any properties of the pentaquark outside of the Borel
window. To find the appropriate Borel window, we prepare a favorable set up of
the correlators and carry out the operator product expansion up to dimension 15
within factorization hypothesis. Our procedures reduce the unwanted high energy
contaminations and enhance the low energy correlation. In the Borel window,
independent analyses for the chiral-even and odd sum rules give the consistent
values of the $\Theta^+$ mass, $1.68\pm0.22$ GeV, and the residue. The parity
is found to be {\it positive}.
"
Leaky modes of a left-handed slab,"Antoine Moreau (LASMEA), Didier Felbacq (GES)","  Using complex plane analysis we show that left-handed slab may support either
leaky slab waves, which are backward because of negative refraction, or leaky
surface waves, which are backward or forward depending on the propagation
direction of the surface wave itself. Moreover, there is a general connection
between the reflection coefficient of the left-handed slab and the one of the
corresponding right-handed slab (with opposite permittivity and permeability)
so that leaky slab modes are excited for the same angle of incidence of the
impinging beam for both structures. Many negative giant lateral shifts can be
explained by the excitation of these leaky modes.

Coulomb blockade of field emission from nanoscale conductors,O. E. Raichev,"  Theoretical description of the field emission of electrons from nanoscale
objects weakly coupled to the cathode is presented. It is shown that the field-
emission current increases in a step-like fashion due to single-electron
charging which leads to abrupt changes of the effective electric field
responsible for the field emission. A detailed consideration of the
current-voltage characteristics is carried out for a nanocluster modelled by a
metallic spherical particle in the close vicinity of the cathode and for a
cylindrical silicon nanowire grown on the cathode surface.

Origamis with non congruence Veech groups,Gabriela Schmithuesen,"  As main result we show that for each g > 1 there is some translation surface
of genus g whose Veech group is a non congruence subgroup of SL(2,Z). We use
origamis/square-tiled surfaces to produce our examples. The article is divided
into two parts: In the first part we introduce translation surfaces, origamis,
Veech groups and Teichmueller curves and show for two origamis in genus 2 that
their Veech groups are non congruence groups; in the second part we provide a
technique that produces sequences of origamis whose Veech groups are
decreasing. This is used to prove the main result.

Thermodynamic Stability - A note on a footnote in Ruelle's book,Bernhard Baumgartner,"  Thermodynamic stable interaction pair potentials which are not of the form

"Entanglement entropy at infinite randomness fixed points in higher
  dimensions","Yu-Cheng Lin, Ferenc Igloi and Heiko Rieger","  The entanglement entropy of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising model
is studied with a numerical implementation of the strong disorder
renormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the entropy per surface area
diverges at, and only at, the quantum phase transition that is governed by an
infinite randomness fixed point. Here we identify a double-logarithmic
multiplicative correction to the area law for the entanglement entropy. This
contrasts with the pure area law valid at the infinite randomness fixed point
in the diluted transverse Ising model in higher dimensions.

Ultrasound attenuation of superfluid $^{3}$He in aerogel,"H.C. Choi, N. Masuhara, B.H. Moon, P. Bhupathi, M.W. Meisel, Y. Lee,
  N. Mulders, S. Higashitani, M. Miura, and K. Nagai","  We have performed longitudinal ultrasound (9.5 MHz) attenuation measurements
in the B-phase of superfluid $^3$He in 98% porosity aerogel down to the zero
temperature limit for a wide range of pressures at zero magnetic field. The
absolute attenuation was determined by direct transmission of sound pulses.
Compared to the bulk fluid, our results revealed a drastically different
behavior in attenuation, which is consistent with theoretical accounts with
gapless excitations and a collision drag effect.

"The Hourglass - Consequences of Pure Hamiltonian Evolution of a
  Radiating System",Donald McCartor,"  Hourglass is the name given here to a formal isolated quantum system that can
radiate. Starting from a time when it defines the system it represents clearly
and no radiation is present, it is given straightforward Hamiltonian evolution.
The question of what significance hourglasses have is raised, and this question
is proposed to be more consequential than the measurement problem.

The Sigma-D Relation for Planetary Nebulae: Preliminary Analysis,"D. Urosevic, B. Vukotic, B. Arbutina, D. Ilic","  An analysis of the relation between radio surface brightness and diameter,
so-called Sigma-D relation, for planetary nebulae (PNe) is presented: i) the
theoretical Sigma-D relation for the evolution of bremsstrahlung surface
brightness is derived; ii) contrary to the results obtained earlier for the
Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) samples, our results show that the updated
sample of Galactic PNe does not severely suffer from volume selection effect -
Malmquist bias (same as for the extragalactic SNR samples) and; iii) we
conclude that the empirical Sigma-D relation for PNe derived in this paper is
not useful for valid determination of distances for all observed PNe with
unknown distances.

polarization conversion of light in a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered

Stopping effects in U+U collisions with a beam energy of 520 MeV/nucleon,"Xiao-Feng Luo, Xin Dong, Ming Shao, Ke-Jun Wu, Cheng Li, Hong-Fang
  Chen, Hu-Shan Xu","  A Relativistic Transport Model (ART1.0) is applied to simulate the stopping
effects in tip-tip and body-body U+U collisions, at a beam kinetic energy of
520 MeV/nucleon. Our simulation results have demonstrated that both central
collisions of the two extreme orientations can achieve full stopping, and also
form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and
long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward
flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body
ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body
central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$
in contrast to zero in tip-tip ones. Thus the extreme circumstance and the
novel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide
a good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.
The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External Target Facility (ETF) to be built at
Lanzhou, China, delivering the uranium beam up to 520 MeV/nucleon is expected
to make significant contribution to explore the nuclear equation of state
(EoS).
"
QED for fields obeying a square root operator equation,Tobias Gleim,"  Instead of using local field equations - like the Dirac equation for spin-1/2
and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use
non-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter
equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the
correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.
By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and
taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or
for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the
scalar case. These results are then compared with the corresponding ones based
on the Klein-Gordon equation. A proposal of how to transfer these reflections
to the spin-1/2 case is also presented.
"
Feedback from first radiation sources: H- photodissociation,"Leonid Chuzhoy, Michael Kuhlen, Paul R. Shapiro","  During the epoch of reionization, the formation of radiation sources is
accompanied by the growth of a H- photodissociating flux. We estimate the
impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the
first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and
Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the
primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.

The 3D +-J Ising model at the ferromagnetic transition line,"Martin Hasenbusch, Francesco Parisen Toldin, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore
  Vicari","  We study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model
[with a random-exchange probability $P(J_{xy}) = p \delta(J_{xy} - J) + (1-p)
\delta(J_{xy} + J)$] at the transition line between the paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic phase, which extends from $p=1$ to a multicritical (Nishimori)
point at $p=p_N\approx 0.767$. By a finite-size scaling analysis of Monte Carlo
simulations at various values of $p$ in the region $p_N<p<1$, we provide strong
numerical evidence that the critical behavior along the ferromagnetic
transition line belongs to the same universality class as the three-dimensional
randomly-dilute Ising model. We obtain the results $\nu=0.682(3)$ and
$\eta=0.036(2)$ for the critical exponents, which are consistent with the
estimates $\nu=0.683(2)$ and $\eta=0.036(1)$ at the transition of
randomly-dilute Ising models.

Star Formation in the Bok Globule CB54,David R. Ciardi and Cynthia Gomez Martin,"  We present mid-infrared (10.4 \micron, 11.7 \micron, and 18.3 \micron)
imaging intended to locate and characterize the suspected protostellar
components within the Bok globule CB54. We detect and confirm the protostellar
status for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for
CB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \approx 8 L_\sun$, and we estimate a
central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of
${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the
dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0
protostars.

"Quantitative Resolution to some ""Absolute Discrepancies"" in Cancer
  Theories: a View from Phage lambda Genetic Switch",P. Ao,"  Is it possible to understand cancer? Or more specifically, is it possible to
understand cancer from genetic side? There already many answers in literature.
The most optimistic one has claimed that it is mission-possible. Duesberg and
his colleagues reviewed the impressive amount of research results on cancer
accumulated over 100 years. It confirms the a general opinion that considering
all available experimental results and clinical observations there is no cancer
theory without major difficulties, including the prevailing gene-based cancer
theories. They have then listed 9 ""absolute discrepancies"" for such cancer
theory. In this letter the quantitative evidence against one of their major
reasons for dismissing mutation cancer theory, by both in vivo experiment and a
first principle computation, is explicitly pointed out.

"Reduced phase space and toric variety coordinatizations of Delzant
  spaces",J.J. Duistermaat and A. Pelayo,"  In this note we describe the natural coordinatizations of a Delzant space
defined as a reduced phase space (symplectic geometry view-point) and give
explicit formulas for the coordinate transformations. For each fixed point of
the torus action on the Delzant polytope, we have a maximal coordinatization of
an open cell in the Delzant space which contains the fixed point. This cell is
equal to the domain of definition of one of the natural coordinatizations of
the Delzant space as a toric variety (complex algebraic geometry view-point),
and we give an explicit formula for the toric variety coordinates in terms of
the reduced phase space coordinates. We use considerations in the maximal
coordinate neighborhoods to give simple proofs of some of the basic facts about
the Delzant space, as a reduced phase space, and as a toric variety. These can
be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make
the presentation more self-contained.

Fragmentation of general relativistic quasi-toroidal polytropes,"Burkhard Zink, Nikolaos Stergioulas, Ian Hawke, Christian D. Ott, Erik

hole formation in relativistic stars. In addition to the standard scenario - an
axially symmetric dynamical instability forming a horizon at the star's center
- the recently found low-$T/|W|$ instabilities are shown to lead to
fragmentation and off-center horizon formation in differentially rotating
stars. This process might be an alternative pathway to produce SMBHs from
supermassive stars with inefficient angular momentum transport.

A variational formulation of electrodynamics with external sources,"Antonio De Nicola, Wlodzimierz M. Tulczyjew","  We present a variational formulation of electrodynamics using de Rham even
and odd differential forms. Our formulation relies on a variational principle
more complete than the Hamilton principle and thus leads to field equations
with external sources and permits the derivation of the constitutive relations.
We interpret a domain in space-time as an odd de Rham 4-current. This permits a
treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In
particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using
a current with a one point support.

"Protein and ionic surfactants - promoters and inhibitors of contact line

drop wets a ""clean"" surface and the surfactant-laden drop wets an
auto-precursored surface.
"
Type D Einstein spacetimes in higher dimensions,"Vojtech Pravda, Alena Pravdova, Marcello Ortaggio","  We show that all static spacetimes in higher dimensions are of Weyl types G,
I_i, D or O. This applies also to stationary spacetimes if additional
conditions are fulfilled, as for most known black hole/ring solutions. (The
conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The
n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are
briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.

Eigen Equation of the Nonlinear Spinor,"Ying-Qiu Gu, Ta-tsien Li","  How to effectively solve the eigen solutions of the nonlinear spinor field

form of the eigen equation of the nonlinear spinor, and then propose a scheme
to solve their numerical solutions. This simplified equation has elegant and
neat structure, which is more convenient for both theoretical analysis and
numerical computation.

Measurement of B(D_S^+ --> ell^+ nu) and the Decay Constant f_D_{S^+},"CLEO Collaboration: T. K. Pedlar, et al","  We examine e+e- --> Ds- Ds*+ and Ds*- Ds+ interactions at 4170 MeV using the
CLEO-c detector in order to measure the decay constant fDs+. We use the Ds+ -->
l+ nu channel, where the l+ designates either a mu+ or a tau+, when the tau+
--> pi+ nu. Analyzing both modes independently, we determine B(Ds+ --> mu+ nu)
= (0.594 +- 0.066 +- 0.031)%, and B(Ds+ --> tau+ nu) = (8.0 +- 1.3 +- 0.4)%. We
also analyze them simultaneously to find an effective value of B{eff}(Ds+ -->
mu+ nu) = (0.638 +- 0.059 +- 0.033)% and extract fDs = (274 +- 13 +- 7) MeV.
Combining with our previous determination of B(D+ -> mu+ nu), we also find the
ratio fDs/fD+ = 1.23 +- 0.11 +- 0.04. We compare to current theoretical
estimates. Finally, we find B(Ds+ --> e+ nu) < 1.3 x10^{-4} at 90% confidence
level.

"Broadening the Higgs Boson with Right-Handed Neutrinos and a Higher
  Dimension Operator at the Electroweak Scale",Michael L. Graesser,"  The existence of certain TeV suppressed higher-dimension operators may open
up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed
neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs
boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are
subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic
decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.
A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced
vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed
using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel
decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental
constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question
of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the
approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.

Coulomb blockade of anyons,Dmitri V. Averin and James A. Nesteroff,"  Coulomb interaction turns anyonic quasiparticles of a primary quantum Hall
liquid with filling factor $\nu =1/(2m+1)$ into hard-core anyons. We have
developed a model of coherent transport of such quasiparticles in systems of
multiple antidots by extending the Wigner-Jordan description of 1D abelian
anyons to tunneling problems. We show that the anyonic exchange statistics
manifests itself in tunneling conductance even in the {\em absence} of
quasiparticle exchanges. In particular, it can be seen as a non-vanishing
resonant peak associated with quasiparticle tunneling through a line of three
antidots.

70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

Quantum electromagnetic X-waves,"Alessandro Ciattoni, Claudio Conti","  We show that two distinct quantum states of the electromagnetic field can be
associated to a classical vector X wave or a propagation-invariant solution of
Maxwell equations. The difference between the two states is of pure quantum
mechanical origin since they are internally entangled and disentangled,
respectively and can be generated by different linear or nonlinear processes.
Detection and generation of Schr\""odinger-cat states comprising two entangled
X-waves and their possible applications are discussed.

"Multiple Unfoldings of Orbifold Singularities: Engineering Geometric
  Analogies to Unification",Jacob L. Bourjaily,"  Katz and Vafa showed how charged matter can arise geometrically by the
deformation of ADE-type orbifold singularities in type IIa, M-theory, and
F-theory compactifications. In this paper we use those same basic ingredients,
used there to geometrically engineer specific matter representations, here to
deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally
compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea
explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand
unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,
the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model
fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex
structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the
arbitrariness of their relative positions.
"
"Geometrically Engineering the Standard Model: Locally Unfolding Three
  Families out of E8",Jacob L. Bourjaily,"  This paper extends and builds upon the results of an earlier paper, in which
we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform
geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.
This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically
engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the
three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a
single, isolated E8 singularity.

"
Giant Planet Migration in Viscous Power-Law Discs,R. G. Edgar,"  Many extra-solar planets discovered over the past decade are gas giants in
tight orbits around their host stars. Due to the difficulties of forming these
`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their
present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

"Worldsheet Instantons and Torsion Curves, Part B: Mirror Symmetry","Volker Braun, Maximilian Kreuzer, Burt A. Ovrut, Emanuel Scheidegger","  We apply mirror symmetry to the problem of counting holomorphic rational
curves in a Calabi-Yau threefold X with Z_3 x Z_3 Wilson lines. As we found in
Part A [hep-th/0703182], the integral homology group H_2(X,Z)=Z^3 + Z_3 + Z_3
contains torsion curves. Using the B-model on the mirror of X as well as its
covering spaces, we compute the instanton numbers. We observe that X is
self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we
derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In
particular, this yields the first example where the instanton number depends on
the torsion part of its homology class. Another consequence is that the
threefold X provides a non-toric example for the conjectured exchange of
torsion subgroups in mirror manifolds.

Disorder screening near the Mott-Anderson transition,"M. C. O. Aguiar, V. Dobrosavljevic, E. Abrahams, G. Kotliar","  Correlation-driven screening of disorder is studied within the typical-medium
dynamical mean-field theory (TMT-DMFT) of the Mott-Anderson transition. In the
strongly correlated regime, the site energies epsilon_R^i characterizing the
effective disorder potential are strongly renormalized due to the phenomenon of
Kondo pinning. This effect produces very strong screening when the interaction
U is stronger then disorder W, but applies only to a fraction of the sites in
the opposite limit (U<W).

incorporating nanometer-scale electromigrated gaps between extended electrodes.
Molecules in the nanogap active regions exhibit hallmarks of very high Raman

"Dramatic Variability of X-ray Absorption Lines in the Black Hole
  Candidate Cygnus X-1",Chulhoon Chang and Wei Cui,"  We report results from a 30 ks observation of Cygnus X-1 with the High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-ray
Observatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.
The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the
binary system. Therefore, they may provide valuable diagnostics on the physical
condition of the wind. We discuss the implications of the results.

filling nor the band parameters are significantly affected by the oxygen
reduction process. Instead, we show that the main electronic role of the
reduction process is to remove an anisotropic leading edge gap around the Fermi
surface. While the nodal leading edge gap is induced by long-range
antiferomagnetic order, the origin of the antinodal one remains unclear.

  Sahu, D. Tenerelli, A. Udalski, and P. Yock","  A space-based gravitational microlensing exoplanet survey will provide a
statistical census of exoplanets with masses down to 0.1 Earth-masses and
orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to
all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of
planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide
results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with
short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a
space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other
methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive
statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets
that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet
sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of
the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify
and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of
planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is
likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature
of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and
habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an
example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these
objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the
NASA Discovery Program cost cap.

USco1606-1935: An Unusually Wide Low-Mass Triple System?,"Adam L. Kraus, Lynne A. Hillenbrand (Caltech)","  We present photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic observations of
USco160611.9-193532 AB, a candidate ultrawide (~1600 AU), low-mass (M_tot~0.4
M_sun) multiple system in the nearby OB association Upper Scorpius. We conclude
that both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also
present high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a
close binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the
system would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have
unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.
However, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on
probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation
range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that
there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass
association members will be separated in projection by <15"", so analysis of the
wide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all
wide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at
the 98% confidence level.

Particle propagation in cosmological backgrounds,Daniel Arteaga,"  We study the quantum propagation of particles in cosmological backgrounds, by
considering a doublet of massive scalar fields propagating in an expanding
universe, possibly filled with radiation. We focus on the dissipative effects
related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result
that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear
order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion
parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the
vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and
briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.

"Rotation Measures of Extragalactic Sources Behind the Southern Galactic

  Way","J.C. Brown, M. Haverkorn, B.M. Gaensler, A.R. Taylor, N.S. Bizunok,
  N.M. McClure-Griffiths, J.M. Dickey, A.J. Green","  We present new Faraday rotation measures (RMs) for 148 extragalactic radio
sources behind the southern Galactic plane (253o < l < 356o, |b| < 1.5o), and
use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale
structure of the Milky Way's magnetic field. We show that the magnitudes of
these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

On iterated image size for point-symmetric relations,Yahya Ould Hamidoune,"  Let $\Gamma =(V,E)$ be a point-symmetric reflexive relation and let $v\in V$
such that
  $|\Gamma (v)|$ is finite (and hence $|\Gamma (x)|$ is finite for all $x$, by
the transitive action of the group of automorphisms). Let $j\in \N$ be an
integer such that $\Gamma ^j(v)\cap \Gamma ^{-}(v)=\{v\}$. Our main result
states that
  $$ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)|\ge | \Gamma ^{j-1} (v)| + |\Gamma (v)|-1.$$
  As an application we have $ |\Gamma ^{j} (v)| \ge 1+(|\Gamma (v)|-1)j.$ The
last result confirms a recent conjecture of Seymour in the case of
vertex-symmetric graphs. Also it gives a short proof for the validity of the
Caccetta-H\""aggkvist conjecture for vertex-symmetric graphs and generalizes an
additive result of Shepherdson.

"Entanglement increase from local interactions with
  not-completely-positive maps","Thomas F. Jordan, Anil Shaji and E. C. G. Sudarshan","  Simple examples are constructed that show the entanglement of two qubits
being both increased and decreased by interactions on just one of them. One of
the two qubits interacts with a third qubit, a control, that is never entangled
or correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,
but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled
qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to
separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two
qubits are made with a swap operation between one of the qubits and a control;
then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.
When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state
of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two
independent interactions that individually give exponential decay of the
entanglement can cause the entanglement to not decay exponentially but,
instead, go to zero at a finite time.

Extended solar emission - an analysis of the EGRET data,"Elena Orlando, Dirk Petry and Andrew Strong","  The Sun was recently predicted to be an extended source of gamma-ray
emission, produced by inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic-ray electrons with
the solar radiation. The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse
extragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While
this emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the
situation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed
study of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for
the effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which
interfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon
signal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for
emission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our
model for the extended emission.

Mass and Temperature of the TWA 7 Debris Disk,"B. C. Matthews (Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, Canada), P. G.
  Kalas (UC Berkeley, U.S.A.), M. C. Wyatt (University of Cambridge, U.K.)","  We present photometric detections of dust emission at 850 and 450 micron
around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk
around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron
flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in
the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of
disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.
debris) as a function of spectral type.
"
Annealed importance sampling of dileucine peptide,Edward Lyman and Daniel M. Zuckerman,"  Annealed importance sampling is a means to assign equilibrium weights to a
nonequilibrium sample that was generated by a simulated annealing protocol. The
weights may then be used to calculate equilibrium averages, and also serve as
an ``adiabatic signature'' of the chosen cooling schedule. In this paper we
demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that
equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For
this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient
than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering
whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the
beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as
it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.
Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.

A General Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Equation and its Associated Entropy,"Veit Schwammle, Evaldo M. F. Curado, Fernando D. Nobre","  A recently introduced nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, derived directly from
a master equation, comes out as a very general tool to describe
phenomenologically systems presenting complex behavior, like anomalous
diffusion, in the presence of external forces. Such an equation is
characterized by a nonlinear diffusion term that may present, in general, two
distinct powers of the probability distribution. Herein, we calculate the
stationary-state distributions of this equation in some special cases, and
introduce associated classes of generalized entropies in order to satisfy the
H-theorem. Within this approach, the parameters associated with the transition
rates of the original master-equation are related to such generalized
entropies, and are shown to obey some restrictions. Some particular cases are
discussed.

Modeling Accretion Disk X-ray Continuum of Black Hole Candidates,Gabor Pszota and Wei Cui,"  We critically examine issues associated with determining the fundamental
properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

Inapproximability of Maximum Weighted Edge Biclique and Its Applications,Jinsong Tan,"  Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both}
positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted
edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a
bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has
various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range
of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max
\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where
$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in
\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is
$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for
the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless
$\mathsf{RP=NP}$.

diffraction-limited at 30-m apertures even without adaptive optics at

isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is of significant importance for studying the
structure of systems as diverse as the neutron-rich nuclei and the neutron
stars. A number of reactions using the dynamical and the statistical models of
multifragmentation, and the experimental isoscaling observable, is studied to
extract information on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. It is
observed that the dynamical and the statistical model calculations give
consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to
be small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to
obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely "" stiff "" and "" soft ""
form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important
implications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.

system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable

competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a
general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation
rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which
predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the
new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate
of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases
accessible from it.

Application of Ewald summations to long-range dispersion forces,"Pieter J. in 't Veld, Ahmed E. Ismail, and Gary S. Grest","  We present results illustrating the effects of using explicit summation terms

the use of long-range summations, even with a short ``crossover radius,''
yields results that are consistent with simulations using large cutoff radii.
Simulations of SPC/E water demonstrate that the long-range dispersion forces
are of secondary importance to the Coulombic forces. In both cases, we find
that the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rm
c}^{\mathbf k}$ plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the
long-range dispersion correction, although its effect is secondary when
Coulombic interactions are also present.

  of galaxies Sersic 159-03","N. Werner, J.S. Kaastra, Y. Takei, R. Lieu, J. Vink, T. Tamura","  We present an analysis of new Suzaku data and archival data from XMM-Newton
of the cluster of galaxies Sersic 159-03, which has a strong soft X-ray excess
emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft
excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton
observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the
position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant
azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with
models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using
the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected
properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed
properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal
interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated
with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying
population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.

Geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio frequency potential,P. Zhang and L. You,"  We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio
frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a
time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is
shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berry's phase, to the adiabatically
evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to
depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the
atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field'' of the total B-field,
including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for
several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing
adiabatic rf potentials.

"The Transition from the First Stars to the Second Stars in the Early
  Universe","Britton D. Smith, Steinn Sigurdsson","  We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of star
formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a
metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the
radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic
simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,
led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to
the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with
metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5
Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core
reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4
Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with
metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share
most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass
proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=
10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower
limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second
generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more
massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

"Super Star Cluster Velocity Dispersions and Virial Masses in the M82
  Nuclear Starburst",Nate McCrady and James R. Graham,"  We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory to
measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) in
the nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr,
which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity
dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the
kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6
solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.
Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular
clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs
are a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function
for the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.
This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the
Antennae galaxies.

The few scales of nuclei and nuclear matter,"A. Delfino, T. Frederico, V.S. Timoteo, Lauro Tomio","  The well-known correlations of low-energy three and four-nucleon observables
with a typical three-nucleon scale (e.g., the Tjon line) is extended to light
nuclei and nuclear matter. Evidence for the scaling between light nuclei
binding energies and the triton one are pointed out. We argue that the
saturation energy and density of nuclear matter are correlated to the triton
binding energy. The available systematic nuclear matter calculations indicate a
possible band structure representing these correlations.

"Implementation of holonomic quantum computation through engineering and
  manipulating environment","Zhang-qi Yin, Fu-li Li, Peng Peng","  We consider an atom-field coupled system, in which two pairs of four-level
atoms are respectively driven by laser fields and trapped in two distant
cavities that are connected by an optical fiber. First, we show that an
effective squeezing reservoir can be engineered under appropriate conditions.
Then, we show that a two-qubit geometric CPHASE gate between the atoms in the
two cavities can be implemented through adiabatically manipulating the
engineered reservoir along a closed loop. This scheme that combines engineering
environment with decoherence-free space and geometric phase quantum computation
together has the remarkable feature: a CPHASE gate with arbitrary phase shift
is implemented by simply changing the strength and relative phase of the
driving fields.

"Vortex state in a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor based
  on the quasiclassical theory","Masanori Ichioka, Hiroto Adachi, Takeshi Mizushima, Kazushige Machida","  We investigate the vortex state with Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
modulations suggested for a high field phase of CeCoIn_5. On the basis of the
quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we calculate the three dimensional structure
of pair potentials, internal magnetic fields, paramagnetic moments, and
electronic states, for the s-wave and the d-wave pairings comparatively. The
\pi-phase shift of the pair potential at the FFLO nodal plane or at the vortex
core induces sharp peak states in the local density of states, and enhances the
local paramagnetic moment. We also discuss the NMR spectrum and the neutron
scattering as methods to detect the FFLO structure.

Search for Chaotic Behavior in a Flapping Flag,J. O. McCaslin and P. R. Broussard,"  We measured the correlation of the times between successive flaps of a flag
for a variety of wind speeds and found no evidence of low dimensional chaotic
behavior in the return maps of these times. We instead observed what is best
modeled as random times determined by an exponential distribution. This study
was done as an undergraduate experiment and illustrates the differences between
low dimensional chaotic and possibly higher dimensional chaotic systems.

Optimal Shape Design for Stokes Flow Via Minimax Differentiability,"Z.M. Gao, Y.C. Ma, H.W. Zhuang","  This paper is concerned with a shape sensitivity analysis of a viscous
incompressible fluid driven by Stokes equations with nonhomogeneous boundary
condition. The structure of shape gradient with respect to the shape of the
variable domain for a given cost function is established by using the
differentiability of a minimax formulation involving a Lagrangian functional
combining with function space parametrization technique or function space
embedding technique. We apply an gradient type algorithm to our problem.
Numerical examples show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the
proposed algorithm is feasible.

"Kinematic Decoupling of Globular Clusters with Extended
  Horizontal-Branch","Young-Wook Lee, Hansung B. Gim, Dana I. Casetti-Dinescu","  About 25% of the Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) exhibit unusually extended
color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

Scalar potential model progress,J. C. Hodge,"  Because observations of galaxies and clusters have been found inconsistent
with General Relativity (GR), the focus of effort in developing a Scalar
Potential Model (SPM) has been on the examination of galaxies and clusters. The
SPM has been found to be consistent with cluster cellular structure, the flow
of IGM from spiral galaxies to elliptical galaxies, intergalactic redshift
without an expanding universe, discrete redshift, rotation curve (RC) data
without dark matter, asymmetric RCs, galaxy central mass, galaxy central
velocity dispersion, and the Pioneer Anomaly. In addition, the SPM suggests a
model of past expansion, past contraction, and current expansion of the
universe. GR corresponds to the SPM in the limit in which the effect of the
Sources and Sinks approximate a flat scalar potential field such as between
clusters and on the solar system scale, which is small relative to the distance
to a Source.

"Teleparallel Version of the Stationary Axisymmetric Solutions and their
  Energy Contents",M. Sharif and M. Jamil Amir,"  This work contains the teleparallel version of the stationary axisymmetric
solutions. We obtain the tetrad and the torsion fields representing these
solutions. The tensor, vector and axial-vector parts of the torsion tensor are
evaluated. It is found that the axial-vector has component only along $\rho$
and $z$ directions. The three possibilities of the axial vector depending on
the metric function $B$ are discussed. The vector related with spin has also
been evaluated and the corresponding extra Hamiltonian is furnished. Further,
we use the teleparallel version of M$\ddot{o}$ller prescription to find the
energy-momentum distribution of the solutions. It is interesting to note that
(for $\lambda=1$) energy and momentum densities in teleparallel theory are
equal to the corresponding quantities in GR plus an additional quantity in
each, which may become equal under certain conditions. Finally, we discuss the
two special cases of the stationary axisymmetric solutions.

"Relativistic treatment in D-dimensions to a spin-zero particle with
  noncentral equal scalar and vector ring-shaped Kratzer potential","Sameer M. Ikhdair, Ramazan Sever","  The Klein-Gordon equation in D-dimensions for a recently proposed Kratzer
potential plus ring-shaped potential is solved analytically by means of the
conventional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The exact energy bound-states and the
corresponding wave functions of the Klein-Gordon are obtained in the presence
of the noncentral equal scalar and vector potentials. The results obtained in
this work are more general and can be reduced to the standard forms in
three-dimensions given by other works.

Long Distance Signaling Using Axion-like Particles,Daniel D. Stancil,"  The possible existence of axion-like particles could lead to a new type of
long distance communication. In this work, basic antenna concepts are defined
and a Friis-like equation is derived to facilitate long-distance link
calculations. An example calculation is presented showing that communication
over distances of 1000 km or more may be possible for $m_{a}< 3.5$ meV and
$g_{a\gamma \gamma} > 5 \times 10^{- 8} {\text{GeV}}^{- 1}$.
"
Weighted percolation on directed networks,"Juan G. Restrepo, Edward Ott, Brian R. Hunt","  We present an analysis of the percolation transition for general node removal
strategies valid for locally tree-like directed networks. On the basis of
heuristic arguments we predict that, if the probability of removing node $i$ is
$p_i$, the network disintegrates if $p_i$ is such that the largest eigenvalue
of the matrix with entries $A_{ij}(1-p_i)$ is less than 1, where $A$ is the
adjacency matrix of the network. The knowledge or applicability of a Markov
network model is not required by our theory, thus making it applicable to
situations not covered by previous works. We test our predicted percolation
criterion against numerical results for different networks and node removal
strategies.
"
Refuting the Pseudo Attack on the REESSE1+ Cryptosystem,"Shenghui Su, and Shuwang Lu","  We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8]
dissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] does
not hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient for
f(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a
logic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4
to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of
qu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +
f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4
and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,
manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is
falsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax
* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To
the signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1
and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.
Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which
connotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in
REESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly
selected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.

"Phase structure of a surface model on dynamically triangulated spheres
  with elastic skeletons",Hiroshi Koibuchi,"  We find three distinct phases; a tubular phase, a planar phase, and the
spherical phase, in a triangulated fluid surface model. It is also found that
these phases are separated by discontinuous transitions. The fluid surface
model is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model
by using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.
The mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no
two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

"Vortex Dynamics at the Initial Stage of Resistive Transition in
  Superconductors with Fractal Cluster Structure",Yuriy I. Kuzmin,"  The effect of fractal normal-phase clusters on vortex dynamics in a
percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains
percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters
of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

The Veldkamp Space of Two-Qubits,"Metod Saniga (ASTRINSTSAV), Michel Planat (FEMTO-ST), Petr Pracna

two-qubits in terms of the points of the generalized quadrangle of order two,
W(2), it is shown that specific subsets of these operators can also be
associated with the points and lines of the four-dimensional projective space
over the Galois field with two elements - the so-called Veldkamp space of W(2).
An intriguing novelty is the recognition of (uni- and tri-centric) triads and
specific pentads of the Pauli operators in addition to the ""classical"" subsets
answering to geometric hyperplanes of W(2).

"Fusion process studied with preequilibrium giant dipole resonance in
  time dependent Hartree-Fock theory","C\'edric Simenel (SPhN, GANIL), Philippe Chomaz (GANIL), Gilles De
  France (GANIL)","  The equilibration of macroscopic degrees of freedom during the fusion of
heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

analysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup in

assessed on experimental setups following published data when available and
extrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewing
the experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2

approach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantages
and drawbacks of each experimental setup.

"Optimal Routing for Decode-and-Forward based Cooperation in Wireless
  Networks",Lawrence Ong and Mehul Motani,"  We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can
help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in
the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the
myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

Dimensional crossover of quantum critical behavior in CeCoIn$_5$,"J.G. Donath, P. Gegenwart, F. Steglich, E.D. Bauer, J.L. Sarrao","  The nature of quantum criticality in CeCoIn$_5$ is studied by low-temperature
thermal expansion $\alpha(T)$. At the field-induced quantum critical point at
H=5 T a crossover scale $T^\star\approx 0.3$ K is observed, separating
$\alpha(T)/T\propto T^{-1}$ from a weaker $T^{-1/2}$ divergence. We ascribe
this change to a crossover in the dimensionality of the critical fluctuations
which may be coupled to a change from unconventional to conventional quantum
criticality. Disorder, whose effect on quantum criticality is studied in
CeCoIn$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ ($0\leq x\leq 0.18$), shifts $T^\star$ towards higher
temperatures.

E_6 and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits,M. J. Duff and S. Ferrara,"  Recent investigations have established an analogy between the entropy of
four-dimensional supersymmetric black holes in string theory and entanglement
in quantum information theory. Examples include: (1) N=2 STU black holes and
the tripartite entanglement of three qubits (2-state systems), where the common
symmetry is [SL(2)]^3 and (2) N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement
of seven qubits where the common symmetry is E_7 which contains [SL(2)]^7. Here
we present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five
dimensions and the bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems),
where the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole
(or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by the
Cartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2
supergravity black holes in both four and five dimensions.

"Stable oscillations of a predator-prey probabilistic cellular automaton:
  a mean-field approach",T\^ania Tom\'e and Kelly C de Carvalho,"  We analyze a probabilistic cellular automaton describing the dynamics of
coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are
localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

  Martino (2), A. Aungwerojwit (1 and 3) ((1) University of Warwick, UK, (2)
  INAF - Osservatorio di Capodimonte, Italy, (3) Naresuan University, Thailand)","  Intermediate polars (IPs) are cataclysmic variables which contain magnetic
white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.
Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through
the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

this theory. If formula is to be proved (or disproved) then it has to be
reduced to axioms. If every transformation is deducible then also optimal
transformation is deducible. If every transformation is exponential then
optimal one is too, what allows to define lower bound for discussed problem to
be exponential (outside P). Then we show algorithm for NDTM solving the same
problem in O(n^c) (so problem is in NP), what proves that P \neq NP.
  Article proves also that result of relativisation of P=NP question and oracle
shown by Baker-Gill-Solovay distinguish between deterministic and
non-deterministic calculation models. If there exists oracle A for which
P^A=NP^A then A consists of infinite number of algorithms, DTMs, axioms and
predicates, or like NDTM infinite number of simultaneous states.

"Temperature dependence of Coulomb drag between finite-length quantum
  wires","J. Peguiron, C. Bruder, B. Trauzettel","  We evaluate the Coulomb drag current in two finite-length
Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid wires coupled by an electrostatic backscattering
interaction. The drag current in one wire shows oscillations as a function of
the bias voltage applied to the other wire, reflecting interferences of the
plasmon standing waves in the interacting wires. In agreement with this
picture, the amplitude of the current oscillations is reduced with increasing
temperature. This is a clear signature of non-Fermi-liquid physics because for
coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the
temperature is raised.

"Effects of Imperfect Gate Operations in Shor's Prime Factorization
  Algorithm","Hao Guo, Gui Lu Long and Yang Sun","  The effects of imperfect gate operations in implementation of Shor's prime
factorization algorithm are investigated. The gate imperfections may be
classified into three categories: the systematic error, the random error, and
the one with combined errors. It is found that Shor's algorithm is robust
against the systematic errors but is vulnerable to the random errors. Error
threshold is given to the algorithm for a given number $N$ to be factorized.

"Using decomposed household food acquisitions as inputs of a Kinetic
  Dietary Exposure Model","Olivier Allais (CORELA), Jessica Tressou (METARISK, Hkust-Ismt)","  Foods naturally contain a number of contaminants that may have different and
long term toxic effects. This paper introduces a novel approach for the
assessment of such chronic food risk that integrates the pharmacokinetic
properties of a given contaminant. The estimation of such a Kinetic Dietary
Exposure Model (KDEM) should be based on long term consumption data which, for
the moment, can only be provided by Household Budget Surveys such as the
SECODIP panel in France. A semi parametric model is proposed to decompose a
series of household quantities into individual quantities which are then used
as inputs of the KDEM. As an illustration, the risk assessment related to the
presence of methyl mercury in seafood is revisited using this novel approach.

"Dust and gas emission in the prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 at
  sub-arcsecond resolution","H. Beuther, Q. Zhang, E.A. Bergin, T.K. Sridharan, T.R. Hunter, S.
  Leurini","  Aiming at a better understand of the physical and chemical processes in the
hot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the
prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the
hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

differential equation is generalized to be applicable for systems containing

be in exact agreement with Agrawal's formalism.

A critical theory of quantum entanglement for the Hydrogen molecule,"Tina A.C. Maiolo, Luigi Martina, Giulio Soliani","  In this paper we investigate some entanglement properties for the Hydrogen
molecule considered as a two interacting spin 1/2 (qubit) model. The
entanglement related to the $H_{2}$ molecule is evaluated both using the von
Neumann entropy and the Concurrence and it is compared with the corresponding
quantities for the two interacting spin system. Many aspects of these functions
are examinated employing in part analytical and, essentially, numerical
techniques. We have compared analogous results obtained by Huang and Kais a few
years ago. In this respect, some possible controversial situations are
presented and discussed.

Fractionally charged excitations on frustrated lattices,"E. Runge, F. Pollmann, P. Fulde","  Systems of strongly correlated fermions on certain geometrically frustrated
lattices at particular filling factors support excitations with fractional
charges $\pm e/2$. We calculate quantum mechanical ground states, low--lying
excitations and spectral functions of finite lattices by means of numerical
diagonalization. The ground state of the most thoroughfully studied case, the
criss-crossed checkerboard lattice, is degenerate and shows long--range order.
Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably
leading to bound states of large spatial extent. Consequently, the
quasi-particle weight is reduced, which reflects the internal dynamics of the
fractionally charged excitations. By using an additional parameter, we
fine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are
manifestly deconfined--the so--called Rokhsar--Kivelson point. For a deeper
understanding of the low--energy physics of these models and for numerical
advantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.

BaBar detector at the PEP2 storage ring, corresponding to 232 million $B\bar B$

$\psi(2S)$ meson. No direct {\it CP}-violating charge asymmetry is observed.

are a generalization of pure-state qubits and Bell states to thermal mixtures.
A scheme is then presented to discriminate between the four thermal-Bell states
without photon number resolving detection but with Kerr nonlinear interactions

investigated previously and the existence of stable solitonic stars excluded

"Many-to-One Throughput Capacity of IEEE 802.11 Multi-hop Wireless
  Networks","Chi Pan Chan, Soung Chang Liew, An Chan","  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,
one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

fully-gapped superconductivity with a gap anisotropy of 30%. Measurements
performed at fields of 2 and 6 T display a hexagonal Abrikosov flux line

31-40 {\AA}, in agreement with the value derived from the upper critical field
Hc2. We observe a reduction in size of the vortex cores (and hence the
coherence length) with increasing field which is consistent with the
unexpectedly high and unsaturated upper critical field reported.

L-edge, Tb L- and M-edges, were performed on single crystals of TbMn2O5. X-ray
intensities were observed at a forbidden Bragg position in the ferroelectric
phases, in addition to the lattice and the magnetic modulation peaks.
Temperature dependences of their intensities and the relation between the
modulation wave vectors provide direct evidences of exchange striction induced
ferroelectricity. Resonant x-ray scattering results demonstrate the presence of
multiple magnetic orders by exhibiting their different temperature dependences.
The commensurate-to-incommensurate phase transition around 24 K is attributed
to discommensuration through phase slipping of the magnetic orders in spin
frustrated geometries. We proposed that the low temperature incommensurate
phase consists of the commensurate magnetic domains separated by anti-phase
domain walls which reduce spontaneous polarizations abruptly at the transition.

"Self-diffusion and Interdiffusion in Al80Ni20 Melts: Simulation and
  Experiment","Juergen Horbach, Subir K. Das, Axel Griesche, Michael-Peter Macht,
  Guenter Frohberg, Andreas Meyer","  A combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) computer
simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.
Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the
long-capillary (LC) method and by quasielastic neutron scattering. The LC
method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under
consideration.

globular cluster system color distributions. Understanding the mechanisms which
lead to multiple globular cluster sub-populations is essential for a complete
picture of massive galaxy formation. By assuming that globular cluster
formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial
variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &
Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the
distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric
radius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular
clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the
observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can
be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar
populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population
of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very
good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate
the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity
distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of
merger-induced globular cluster formation and a non-linear color-metallicity
transformation, and discuss their influence in the context of our model

"Binaries, microquasars and GLAST",Guillaume Dubus,"  Radio and X-ray observations of the relativistic jets of microquasars show
evidence for the acceleration of particles to very high energies. Signatures of
non-thermal processes occurring closer in to the compact object can also be
found. In addition, three binaries are now established emitters of high (> 100
MeV) and/or very high (> 100GeV) energy gamma-rays. High-energy emission can
originate from a microquasar jet (accretion-powered) or from a shocked pulsar
wind (rotation-powered). I discuss the impact GLAST will have in the very near
future on studies of such binaries. GLAST is expected to shed new light on the
link between accretion and ejection in microquasars and to enable to probe
pulsar winds on small scales in rotation-powered binaries.

"Linearisation of finite abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the

Abelian subgroups of the Cremona group of the plane, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris,
S\'er. I 344 (2007), 21-26.] and some description of automorphisms of rational
surfaces.
  Given a finite Abelian subgroup of the Cremona group of the plane, we provide
a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of
automorphisms of a minimal surface.
  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational
transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its
non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,
there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,
whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is
not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.
  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite
order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.

obtained for PTFE films in dependence on deposition conditions. Using the cold

"On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels with Degraded
  Message Sets",Jinhua Jiang and Xin Yan,"  The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a
communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their
respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the
senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message
being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has
advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,
is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,
achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian
cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate
regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the
high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer
considerable improvements over these existing results.

$n$. Solving a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Heilbronn, Olson proved that
  $A$ is complete if $n$ is a prime and if $|A|>2\sqrt{n}.$
  Recently Vu proved that there is an absolute constant $c$, such that for an
arbitrary large $n$, $A$ is complete if $|A|\ge c\sqrt{n},$ and conjectured
that 2 is essentially the right value of $c$. We show that $A$ is complete if
$|A|> 1+2\sqrt{n-4}$, thus proving the last conjecture.

"Hilbert functions of points on Schubert varieties in Orthogonal

multiplicity, or more generally the Hilbert function, at a point on a Schubert
variety in an orthogonal Grassmannian. Standard monomial theory is applied to
translate the problem from geometry to combinatorics. The solution of the
resulting combinatorial problem forms the bulk of the paper. This approach has
been followed earlier to solve the same problem for the Grassmannian and the
symplectic Grassmannian.
  As an application, we present an interpretation of the multiplicity as the
number of non-intersecting lattice paths of a certain kind.
  Taking the Schubert variety to be of a special kind and the point to be the
""identity coset,"" our problem specializes to a problem about Pfaffian ideals
treatments of which by different methods exist in the literature. Also
available in the literature is a geometric solution when the point is a
""generic singularity.""

with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

Crossover behavior in fluids with Coulomb interactions,"O.V. Patsahan, J.-M. Caillol, I.M. Mryglod","  According to extensive experimental findings, the Ginzburg temperature
$t_{G}$ for ionic fluids differs substantially from that of nonionic fluids
[Schr\""oer W., Weig\""{a}rtner H. 2004 {\it Pure Appl. Chem.} {\bf 76} 19]. A
theoretical investigation of this outcome is proposed here by a mean field
analysis of the interplay of short and long range interactions on the value of
$t_{G}$. We consider a quite general continuous charge-asymmetric model made of
charged hard spheres with additional short-range interactions (without
electrostatic interactions the model belongs to the same universality class as
the 3D Ising model). The effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian of the full
system near its gas-liquid critical point is derived from which the Ginzburg
temperature is calculated as a function of the ionicity. The results obtained
in this way for $t_{G}$ are in good qualitative and sufficient quantitative
agreement with available experimental data.

Persistent Currents in Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices,F. Romeo and R. De Luca,"  Starting from the reduced dynamical model of a two-junction quantum
interference device, a quantum analog of the system has been exhibited, in
order to extend the well known properties of this device to the quantum regime.
By finding eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian operator, the

quantum analog of the overdamped two-junction quantum interference device can
be seen as a supercurrent qubit operating in the limit of negligible

"Mid-Infrared Fine Structure Line Ratios in Active Galactic Nuclei
  Observed with Spitzer IRS: Evidence for Extinction by the Torus","R. P. Dudik, J. C. Weingartner, S. Satyapal, J. Fischer, C. C. Dudley,
  B. O'Halloran","  We present the first systematic investigation of the [NeV] (14um/24um) and
[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate
the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

The old open clusters Berkeley 32 and King 11,"Monica Tosi (1), Angela Bragaglia (1), Michele Cignoni (1,2) ((1):
  INAF-Osserv. Astron. Bologna (2): Astronomy Dept., Bologna Univ.)","  We have obtained CCD BVI imaging of the old open clusters Berkeley 32 and
King 11. Using the synthetic colour-magnitude diagram method with three
different sets of stellar evolution models of various metallicities, with and
without overshooting, we have determined their age, distance, reddening, and
indicative metallicity, as well as distance from the Galactic centre and height
from the Galactic plane. The best parameters derived for Berkeley 32 are:
subsolar metallicity (Z=0.008 represents the best choice, Z=0.006 or 0.01 are
more marginally acceptable), age = 5.0-5.5 Gyr (models with overshooting;
without overshooting the age is 4.2-4.4 Gyr with poorer agreement),
(m-M)_0=12.4-12.6, E(B-V)=0.12-0.18 (with the lower value being more probable
because it corresponds to the best metallicity), Rgc ~ 10.7-11 kpc, and |Z| ~
231-254 pc. The best parameters for King 11 are: Z=0.01, age=3.5-4.75 Gyr,
(m-M)_0=11.67-11.75, E(B-V)=1.03-1.06, Rgc ~ 9.2-10 kpc, and |Z| ~ 253-387 pc.

The Genetic Programming Collaboration Network and its Communities,"L. Luthi, M. Tomassini, M. Giacobini, B. W. Langdon","  Useful information about scientific collaboration structures and patterns can
be inferred from computer databases of published papers. The genetic
programming bibliography is the most complete reference of papers on GP\@. In
addition to locating publications, it contains coauthor and coeditor
relationships from which a more complete picture of the field emerges. We treat
these relationships as undirected small world graphs whose study reveals the
community structure of the GP collaborative social network. Automatic analysis
discovers new communities and highlights new facets of them. The investigation
reveals many similarities between GP and coauthorship networks in other
scientific fields but also some subtle differences such as a smaller central
network component and a high clustering.

The Expanding Photosphere Method: Progress and Problems,"J. Vinko, K. Takats","  Distances to well-observed Type II-P SNe are determined from an updated
version of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM), based on recent theoretical
models. The new EPM distances show good agreement with other independent
distances to the host galaxies without any significant systematic bias,
contrary to earlier results in the literature. The accuracy of the method is
comparable with that of the distance measurements for Type Ia SNe.

"Spontaneous Lorentz Violation: Non-Abelian Gauge Fields as
  Pseudo-Goldstone Vector Bosons",J.L. Chkareuli and J.G. Jejelava,"  We argue that non-Abelian gauge fields can be treated as the pseudo-Goldstone
vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

In-medium effects on particle production in heavy ion collisions,"V. Prassa, G. Ferini, T. Gaitanos, H.H. Wolter, G.A. Lalazissis, M. Di
  Toro","  The effect of possible in-medium modifications of nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)
cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions
($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant
relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

The Graham conjecture implies the Erdos-Turan conjecture,Liangpan Li,"  Erd\""{o}s and Tur\'{a}n once conjectured that any set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$
with $\sum_{a\in A}{1}/{a}=\infty$ should contain infinitely many progressions
of arbitrary length $k\geq3$. For the two-dimensional case Graham conjectured
that if $B\subset \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $$\sum\limits_{(x,y)\in
B}\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}=\infty,$$ then for any $s\geq2$, $B$ contains an $s\times
s$ axes-parallel grid. In this paper it is shown that if the Graham conjecture
is true for some $s\geq2$, then the Erd\""{o}s-Tur\'{a}n conjecture is true for
$k=2s-1$.

"Effective conservation of energy and momentum algorithm using switching
  potentials suitable for molecular dynamics simulation of thermodynamical
  systems",Christopher G Jesudason,"  During a crossover via a switching mechanism from one 2-body potential to
another as might be applied in modeling (chemical) reactions in the vicinity of
bond formation, energy violations would occur due to finite step size which
determines the trajectory of the particles relative to the potential
interactions of the unbonded state by numerical (e.g. Verlet) integration. This
problem is overcome by an algorithm which preserves the coordinates of the
system for each move, but corrects for energy discrepancies by ensuring both
energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a
hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the
algorithm. The tests involve checking the rate of energy flow out of the MD
simulation box; in the equilibrium state, no net rate of flows within
experimental error should be observed. The temperature and pressure of the box
should also be invariant within the range of fluctuation of these quantities.
It is demonstrated that the algorithm satisfies these criteria.

M-regularity of the Fano surface,"Andreas H\""oring","  Let $(A,\Theta)$ be a principally polarised abelian variety, and let Y be a

  Let now X be a smooth cubic threefold. By a classical result due to Clemens

J(X) and has minimal cohomology class. In this short note we show that its
structure sheaf is M-regular.

"Signal for space-time noncommutativity: the Z -> gamma gamma decay in
  the renormalizable gauge sector of the theta-expanded NCSM",Josip Trampetic,"  We propose the Z -> gamma gamma decay, a process strictly forbidden in the
standard model, as a signal suitable for the search of noncommutativity of
coordinates at very short distances. We compute the Z -> gamma gamma partial
widthin the framework of the recently proposed renormalizable gauge sector of
the noncommutative standard model. The one-loop renormalizability is obtained
for the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the
first generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free of
divergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in the
noncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would be
of tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentz
invariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma
gamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity
parameter is set around 1 TeV.

"Confinement into a state with persistent current by thermal quenching of
  loop of Josephson junctions",Jorge Berger,"  We study a loop of Josephson junctions that is quenched through its critical
temperature. For three or more junctions, symmetry breaking states can be
achieved without thermal activation, in spite of the fact that the relaxation
time is practically constant when the critical temperature is approached from
above. The probability for these states decreases with quenching time, but the
dependence is not allometric. For large number of junctions, cooling does not
have to be fast. For this case, we evaluate the standard deviation of the
induced flux. Our results are consistent with the available experimental data.

formally justifies the cosmological constant use and suggests a new

"Yield Curve Shapes and the Asymptotic Short Rate Distribution in Affine
  One-Factor Models","Martin Keller-Ressel, Thomas Steiner","  We consider a model for interest rates, where the short rate is given by a
time-homogenous, one-dimensional affine process in the sense of Duffie,
Filipovic and Schachermayer. We show that in such a model yield curves can only
be normal, inverse or humped (i.e. endowed with a single local maximum). Each
case can be characterized by simple conditions on the present short rate. We
give conditions under which the short rate process will converge to a limit
distribution and describe the limit distribution in terms of its cumulant
generating function. We apply our results to the Vasicek model, the CIR model,
a CIR model with added jumps and a model of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type.

Composite fermion wave functions as conformal field theory correlators,"Hans Hansson, Chia-Chen Chang, Jainendra Jain, and Susanne Viefers","  It is known that a subset of fractional quantum Hall wave functions has been
expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling
fractions not contained in the principal Jain series.

"On the potential of transit surveys in star clusters: Impact of
  correlated noise and radial velocity follow-up","Suzanne Aigrain (IoA Cambridge, University of Exeter) and Frederic
  Pont (Geneva Observatory)","  We present an extension of the formalism recently proposed by Pepper & Gaudi
to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,
incorporating the impact of correlated noise on transit time-scales on the
detectability of transits, and simultaneously incorporating the magnitude
limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.
New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial
velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby
(<100 pc) clusters.

[Fe/H] $=-2.0$, which is just at the upper limit of the metallicity for the
observed double-enhanced stars. Using a parametric model, we find that almost
all s-elements were made in a single neutron exposure. This star should be a
member of a post-common-envelope binary. After the s-process material has
experienced only one neutron exposure in the nucleosynthesis region and is
dredged-up to its envelope, the AGB evolution is terminated by the onset of
common-envelope evolution. Based on the high radial-velocity of HE 1305-0007,
we speculate that the star could be a runaway star from a binary system, in
which the AIC event has occurred and produced the r-process elements.

3D photospheric velocity field of a Supergranular cell,"Dario Del Moro, Silvia Giordano, Francesco Berrilli","  We investigate the plasma flow properties inside a Supergranular (SG) cell,
in particular its interaction with small scale magnetic field structures. The
SG cell has been identified using the magnetic network (CaII wing brightness)
as proxy, applying the Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) to high spatial,
spectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3D
velocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two different
photospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the
mean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the
behaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with
cluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the
interaction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.
The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow
from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably
created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On
the edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or
cospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots
of the magnetic network.

WINGS clusters with DEDICA, an adaptive-kernel procedure. We test the procedure
on Monte-Carlo simulations of the observed frames and determine the reliability
for the detected structures. DEDICA identifies at least one reliable structure
in the field of 55 clusters. 40 of these clusters have a total of 69
substructures at the same redshift of the cluster (redshift estimates of
substructures are from color-magnitude diagrams). The fraction of clusters with
subclusters (73%) is higher than in most studies. The presence of subclusters
affects the relative luminosities of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs).

"Ising-like dynamics and frozen states in systems of ultrafine magnetic
  particles","Stefanie Russ, Armin Bunde","  We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study aging phenomena and the occurence of
spinglass phases in systems of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles under
the combined influence of dipolar interaction and anisotropy energy, for
different combinations of positional and orientational disorder. We find that
the magnetic moments oriente themselves preferably parallel to their anisotropy
axes and changes of the total magnetization are solely achieved by 180 degree
flips of the magnetic moments, as in Ising systems. Since the dipolar
interaction favorizes the formation of antiparallel chain-like structures,
antiparallel chain-like patterns are frozen in at low temperatures, leading to
aging phenomena characteristic for spin-glasses. Contrary to the intuition,
these aging effects are more pronounced in ordered than in disordered
structures.

"Continuous interfaces with disorder: Even strong pinning is too weak in
  2 dimensions","C. Kuelske, E. Orlandi","  We consider statistical mechanics models of continuous height effective
interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions
without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs
measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.

On the KK-theory of strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras,"Marius Dadarlat, Wilhelm Winter","  Let $\Dh$ and $A$ be unital and separable $C^{*}$-algebras; let $\Dh$ be
strongly self-absorbing. It is known that any two unital $^*$-homomorphisms
from $\Dh$ to $A \otimes \Dh$ are approximately unitarily equivalent. We show
that, if $\Dh$ is also $K_{1}$-injective, they are even asymptotically
unitarily equivalent. This in particular implies that any unital endomorphism
of $\Dh$ is asymptotically inner. Moreover, the space of automorphisms of $\Dh$
is compactly-contractible (in the point-norm topology) in the sense that for
any compact Hausdorff space $X$, the set of homotopy classes $[X,\Aut(\Dh)]$
reduces to a point. The respective statement holds for the space of unital
endomorphisms of $\Dh$. As an application, we give a description of the
Kasparov group $KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ in terms of $^*$-homomorphisms and
asymptotic unitary equivalence. Along the way, we show that the Kasparov group
$KK(\Dh, A\ot \Dh)$ is isomorphic to $K_0(A\ot \Dh)$.

"
Dust Formation and Survival in Supernova Ejecta,"S. Bianchi, and R. Schneider","  The presence of dust at high redshift requires efficient condensation of
grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

Coulombic contribution to the salt-polyelectrolyte preferential interaction
(Donnan) coefficient and we report extremely accurate analytical expressions
valid in the range of low salt concentration (when polyion radius is smaller
than the Debye length). The analysis is performed at Poisson-Boltzmann level,
in cylindrical geometry, with emphasis on highly charged poly-ions (beyond
``counter-ion condensation''). The results hold for any electrolyte of the form
$z_-$:$z_+$. We also obtain a remarkably accurate expression for the electric

medium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly
periodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from
month to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could
confirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned
to ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution
of the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.
2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant
variations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems
to have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two
years earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of
the USA).

"A Low Complexity Algorithm and Architecture for Systematic Encoding of
  Hermitian Codes","Rachit Agarwal, Ralf Koetter and Emanuel Popovici","  We present an algorithm for systematic encoding of Hermitian codes. For a
Hermitian code defined over GF(q^2), the proposed algorithm achieves a run time
complexity of O(q^2) and is suitable for VLSI implementation. The encoder

achieves a space complexity of O(q^2) in terms of finite field multipliers and

"Quantum criticality and disorder in the antiferromagnetic critical point
  of NiS$_{2}$ pyrite","N. Takeshita, S. Takashima, C. Terakura, H. Nishikubo, S. Miyasaka, M.
  Nohara, Y. Tokura, and H. Takagi","  A quantum critical point (QCP) between the antiferromagnetic and the
paramagnetic phases was realized by applying a hydrostatic pressure of ~ 7 GPa
on single crystals of NiS_{2} pyrite with a low residual resistivity, rho_{0},
of 0.5 mu-Omega-cm. We found that the critical behavior of the resistivity,
rho, in this clean system contrasts sharply with those observed in its
disordered analogue, NiS_{2-x}Se_{x} solid-solution, demonstrating the
unexpectedly drastic effect of disorder on the quantum criticality. Over a
whole paramagnetic region investigated up to P = 9 GPa, a crossover
temperature, defined as the onset of T^{2} dependence of rho, an indication of
Fermi liquid, was suppressed to a substantially low temperature T sim 2 K and,
instead, a non Fermi liquid behavior of rho, T^{3/2}-dependence, robustly
showed up.

Spin coherence of holes in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells,"M. Syperek, D. R. Yakovlev, A. Greilich, J. Misiewicz, M. Bayer, D.

oscillating electron spin beats decay with the radiative lifetime of the
charged exciton of 50 ps. Long lived spin coherence of the holes with dephasing

"Local-field effects in radiatively broadened magneto-dielectric media:
  negative refraction and absorption reduction","J\""urgen K\""astel, Michael Fleischhauer, Gediminas Juzeli\=unas","  We give a microscopic derivation of the Clausius-Mossotti relations for a
homogeneous and isotropic magneto-dielectric medium consisting of radiatively
broadened atomic oscillators. To this end the diagram series of electromagnetic
propagators is calculated exactly for an infinite bi-cubic lattice of
dielectric and magnetic dipoles for a lattice constant small compared to the
resonance wavelength $\lambda$. Modifications of transition frequencies and
linewidth of the elementary oscillators are taken into account in a
selfconsistent way by a proper incorporation of the singular self-interaction
terms. We show that in radiatively broadened media sufficiently close to the
free-space resonance the real part of the index of refraction approaches the
value -2 in the limit of $\rho \lambda^3 \gg 1$, where $\rho$ is the number
density of scatterers. Since at the same time the imaginary part vanishes as
$1/\rho$ local field effects can have important consequences for realizing
low-loss negative index materials.

Search for a fourth generation b'-quark at LEP-II at sqrt{s}=196-209 GeV,"The DELPHI Collaboration, J. Abdallah, et al","  A search for the pair production of fourth generation b'-quarks was performed
using data taken by the DELPHI detector at LEP-II. The analysed data were
collected at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 196 to 209 GeV, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 420 pb^{-1}. No evidence for a signal was found.
Upper limits on BR(b' -> bZ) and BR(b' -> cW) were obtained for b' masses
ranging from 96 to 103 GeV/c^2. These limits, together with the theoretical
branching ratios predicted by a sequential four generations model, were used to
constrain the value of R_{CKM}=|V_{cb'}/V_{tb'}V_{tb}|, where V_{cb'}, V_{tb'}
and V_{tb} are elements of the extended CKM matrix.

"About curvature, conformal metrics and warped products","Fernando Dobarro, Bulent Unal","  We consider the curvature of a family of warped products of two
pseduo-Riemannian manifolds $(B,g_B)$ and $(F,g_F)$ furnished with metrics of
the form $c^{2}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$ and, in particular, of the type $w^{2
\mu}g_B \oplus w^2 g_F$, where $c, w \colon B \to (0,\infty)$ are smooth
functions and $\mu$ is a real parameter. We obtain suitable expressions for the
Ricci tensor and scalar curvature of such products that allow us to establish
results about the existence of Einstein or constant scalar curvature structures
in these categories. If $(B,g_B)$ is Riemannian, the latter question involves
nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations with concave-convex
nonlinearities and singular partial differential equations of the
Lichnerowicz-York type among others.

"Investigation of Colour Reconnection in WW Events with the DELPHI
  detector at LEP-2","The DELPHI Collaboration, J. Abdallah, et al","  In the reaction e+e- -> WW -> (q_1 qbar_2)(q_3 qbar_4) the usual
hadronization models treat the colour singlets q_1 qbar_2 and q_3 qbar_4 coming
from two W bosons independently. However, since the final state partons may
coexist in space and time, cross-talk between the two evolving hadronic systems
may be possible during fragmentation through soft gluon exchange. This effect
is known as Colour Reconnection. In this article the results of the
investigation of Colour Reconnection effects in fully hadronic decays of W
pairs in DELPHI at LEP are presented. Two complementary analyses were
performed, studying the particle flow between jets and W mass estimators, with
negligible correlation between them, and the results were combined and compared
to models. In the framework of the SK-I model, the value for its kappa

"Evolutionary Neural Gas (ENG): A Model of Self Organizing Network from
  Input Categorization","Ignazio Licata, Luigi Lella","  Despite their claimed biological plausibility, most self organizing networks
have strict topological constraints and consequently they cannot take into
account a wide range of external stimuli. Furthermore their evolution is
conditioned by deterministic laws which often are not correlated with the
structural parameters and the global status of the network, as it should happen
in a real biological system. In nature the environmental inputs are noise
affected and fuzzy. Which thing sets the problem to investigate the possibility
of emergent behaviour in a not strictly constrained net and subjected to
different inputs. It is here presented a new model of Evolutionary Neural Gas
(ENG) with any topological constraints, trained by probabilistic laws depending
on the local distortion errors and the network dimension. The network is
considered as a population of nodes that coexist in an ecosystem sharing local
and global resources. Those particular features allow the network to quickly
adapt to the environment, according to its dimensions. The ENG model analysis
shows that the net evolves as a scale-free graph, and justifies in a deeply
physical sense- the term gas here used.

X-ray Dichroism and the Pseudogap Phase of Cuprates,S. Di Matteo and M. R. Norman,"  A recent polarized x-ray absorption experiment on the high temperature
cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 indicates the presence of broken parity
symmetry below the temperature, T*, where a pseudogap appears in photoemission.
We critically analyze the x-ray data, and conclude that a parity-breaking
signal of the kind suggested is unlikely based on the crystal structures
reported in the literature. Possible other origins of the observed dichroism
signal are discussed. We propose x-ray scattering experiments that can be done
in order to determine whether such alternative interpretations are valid or
not.

Solvability of linear equations within weak mixing sets,Alexander Fish,"  We introduce a new class of ""random"" subsets of natural numbers, WM sets.
This class contains normal sets (sets whose characteristic function is a normal

"D-\bar D mixing and rare D decays in the Littlest Higgs model with
  non-unitarity matrix","Chuan-Hung Chen, Chao-Qiang Geng, Tzu-Chiang Yuan","  We study the $D-\bar D$ mixing and rare D decays in the Littlest Higgs model.
As the new weak singlet quark with the electric charge of 2/3 is introduced to
cancel the quadratic divergence induced by the top-quark, the standard unitary
$3\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is extended to a non-unitary
$4\times 3$ matrix in the quark charged currents and Z-mediated flavor changing
neutral currents are generated at tree level. In this model, we show that the
$D-\bar D$ mixing parameter can be as large as the current experimental value
and the decay branching ratio (BR) of $D\to X_u \ga$ is small but its direct CP
asymmetry could be $O(10%)$. In addition, we find that the BRs of $D\to X_u
\ell^{+} \ell^{-}$, $D\to X_u\nu \bar \nu$ and $D\to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ could be
enhanced to be $O(10^{-9})$, $O(10^{-8})$ and $O(10^{-9})$, respectively.

intraplane coupling is estimated to be |J'/J|=1.9 x 10^-2, while fits of the
temperature dependence of the order parameter reveal a critical exponent
beta=0.292(3), implying an intermediate character between pure two- and three-

"Plasmon Amplification through Stimulated Emission at Terahertz
  Frequencies in Graphene","Farhan Rana, Faisal R. Ahmad","  We show that plasmons in two-dimensional graphene can have net gain at
terahertz frequencies. The coupling of the plasmons to interband electron-hole
transitions in population inverted graphene layers can lead to plasmon
amplification through the process of stimulated emission. We calculate plasmon
gain for different electron-hole densities and temperatures and show that the
gain values can exceed $10^{4}$ cm$^{-1}$ in the 1-10 terahertz frequency
range, for electron-hole densities in the $10^{9}$-$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ range,
even when plasmon energy loss due to intraband scattering is considered.
Plasmons are found to exhibit net gain for intraband scattering times shorter
than 100 fs. Such high gain values could allow extremely compact terahertz
amplifiers and oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 $\mu$m range.

Sylvester determinants via a computer-assisted method. For degree at most 5 we
produce the full set of defining equations of the base ideal. The results

for focusing nonlinearity it dominates over filamentation. The patterns
observed in a thermal defocusing medium are interpreted in the framework of our
theory.

Special attention is paid to the structure of sample vectors, which represent
the bridge between the field distributions in the past and future.

"Solving The High Energy Evolution Equation Including Running Coupling
  Corrections",Javier L. Albacete and Yuri V. Kovchegov,"  We study the solution of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the
recently calculated running coupling corrections [hep-ph/0609105,
hep-ph/0609090]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result
of [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling
leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very
large rapidity.

Anomalous c-axis transport in layered metals,D. B. Gutman and D. L. Maslov,"  Transport in metals with strongly anisotropic single-particle spectrum is
studied. Coherent band transport in all directions, described by the standard
Boltzmann equation, is shown to withstand both elastic and inelastic scattering

states located in between the layers is suggested to explain a non-monotonic
temperature dependence of the c-axis resistivity observed in experiments.

  (INAF-OAA), A. Natta (INAF-OAA), R. Neri (IRAM), D. Wilner (CFA), C. Qi (CFA)","  We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations of
the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays
both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust
properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

"Spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8498 A and 8542 A lines in
  the quiet Sun","A. Pietarila, H. Socas-Navarro and T. Bogdan","  The Ca II infrared triplet is one of the few magnetically sensitive
chromospheric lines available for ground-based observations. We present
spectropolarimetric observations of the 8498 A and 8542 A lines in a quiet Sun
region near a decaying active region and compare the results with a simulation
of the lines in a high plasma-beta regime. Cluster analysis of Stokes V profile
pairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close,
often do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topology
is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the
phase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that
Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the
observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the
simulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in the
Ca II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar to
those in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in the
intensity profiles are common.

"Number of moduli of irreducible families of plane curves with nodes and
  cusps",Concettina Galati,"  Consider the family S of irreducible plane curves of degree n with d nodes
and k cusps as singularities. Let W be an irreducible component of S. We
consider the natural rational map from W to the moduli space of curves of genus
g=(n-1)(n-2)/2-d-k. We define the ""number of moduli of W"" as the dimension of
the image of W with respect to this map. If W has the expected dimension equal
to 3n+g-1-k, then the number of moduli of W is at most equal to the min(3g-3,
3g-3+\rho-k), dove \rho is the Brill-Neother number of the linear series of
degree n and dimension 2 on a smooth curve of genus g. We say that W has the
expected number of moduli if the equality holds. In this paper we construct
examples of families of irreducible plane curves with nodes and cusps as
singularities having expected number of moduli and with non-positive
Brill-Noether number.

"Search for Heavy Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons with CMS: Reach and
  Higgs-Mass Precision","S. Gennai, S. Heinemeyer, A. Kalinowski, R. Kinnunen, S. Lethi, A.
  Nikitenko, G. Weiglein","  The search for MSSM Higgs bosons will be an important goal at the LHC. We
analyze the search reach of the CMS experiment for the heavy neutral MSSM Higgs
bosons with an integrated luminosity of 30 or 60 fb^-1. This is done by
combining the latest results for the CMS experimental sensitivities based on
full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM
Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios
in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM
parameter space to experimentally resolve the signals of the two heavy MSSM
Higgs bosons at the LHC.

White dwarf masses derived from planetary nebulae modelling,K. Gesicki and A.A. Zijlstra,"  We compare the mass distribution of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN)
with those of their progeny, white dwarfs (WD). We use a dynamical method to
measure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN mass
distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by
observational or model uncertainties.

Uniqueness theorems for Cauchy integrals,"Mark Melnikov, Alexei Poltoratski and Alexander Volberg","  If $\mu$ is a finite complex measure in the complex plane $\C$ we denote by
$C^\mu$ its Cauchy integral defined in the sense of principal value. The
measure $\mu$ is called reflectionless if it is continuous (has no atoms) and
$C^\mu=0$ at $\mu$-almost every point. We show that if $\mu$ is reflectionless
and its Cauchy maximal function $C^\mu_*$ is summable with respect to $|\mu|$
then $\mu$ is trivial. An example of a reflectionless measure whose maximal
function belongs to the ""weak"" $L^1$ is also constructed, proving that the
above result is sharp in its scale. We also give a partial geometric
description of the set of reflectionless measures on the line and discuss
connections of our results with the notion of sets of finite perimeter in the
sense of De Giorgi.

On the number of moduli of plane sextics with six cusps,Concettina Galati,"  Let S be the variety of irreducible sextics with six cusps as singularities.
Let W be one of irreducible components of W. Denoting by M_4 the space of
moduli of smooth curves of genus 4, the moduli map of W is the rational map
from W to M_4 sending the general point of W, corresponding to a plane curve D,
to the point of M_4 parametrizing the normalization curve of D. The number of
moduli of W is, by definition the dimension of the image of W with respect to
the moduli map. We know that this number is at most equal to seven. In this
paper we prove that both irreducible components of S have number of moduli
exactly equal to seven.

Finally, I apply the algorithm to a simple specific example.

"Temporal Evolution of Step-Edge Fluctuations Under Electromigration
  Conditions","P. J. Rous, T. W. Bole","  The temporal evolution of step-edge fluctuations under electromigration
conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.

wavelet analysis, we examine the three-year WMAP and the NVSS data for
correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable
wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the
correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and
instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the
Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our
detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for
dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to
help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

"Black hole puncture initial data with realistic gravitational wave
  content","Bernard J Kelly, Wolfgang Tichy, Manuela Campanelli, Bernard F Whiting","  We present improved post-Newtonian-inspired initial data for non-spinning
black-hole binaries, suitable for numerical evolution with punctures. We
revisit the work of Tichy et al. [W. Tichy, B. Bruegmann, M. Campanelli, and P.
Diener, Phys. Rev. D 67, 064008 (2003)], explicitly calculating the remaining
integral terms. These terms improve accuracy in the far zone and, for the first
time, include realistic gravitational waves in the initial data. We investigate
the behavior of these data both at the center of mass and in the far zone,
demonstrating agreement of the transverse-traceless parts of the new metric
with quadrupole-approximation waveforms. These data can be used for numerical
evolutions, enabling a direct connection between the merger waveforms and the
post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms.

  K^+ K^-$ Cross Sections Measured with Initial-State Radiation","The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al","  We study the processes $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$,
$K^+K^-\pi^0\pi^0\gamma$ and $K^+ K^- K^+ K^-\gamma$, where the photon is
radiated from the initial state. About 34600, 4400 and 2300 fully reconstructed
events, respectively, are selected from 232 \invfb of \babar data. The
invariant mass of the hadronic final state defines the effective \epem
center-of-mass energy, so that the $K^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ data can be
compared with direct measurements of the $e^+ e^-\to K^+K^- \pipi$ reaction; no
direct measurements exist for the $e^+ e^-\to K^+ K^- \pi^0\pi^0$ or $\epem\to
K^+ K^- K^+ K^-$ reactions. Studying the structure of these events, we find
contributions from a number of intermediate states, and we extract their cross
sections where possible. In particular, we isolate the contribution from $e^+
e^-\to\phi(1020) f_{0}(980)$ and study its structure near threshold. In the
charmonium region, we observe the $J/\psi$ in all three final states and
several intermediate states, as well as the $\psi(2S)$ in some modes, and
measure the corresponding branching fractions. We see no signal for the Y(4260)

Detecting and Characterizing Planetary Systems with Transit Timing,"Jason H. Steffen, B. Scott Gaudi, Eric B. Ford, Eric Agol, Mathew J.
  Holman","  In the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance two
goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5
{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically
increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.
"
d-wave superconductivity from electron-phonon interactions,J.P.Hague,"  I examine electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in the intermediate
coupling and phonon frequency regime of the quasi-2D Holstein model. I use an
extended Migdal-Eliashberg theory which includes vertex corrections and spatial
fluctuations. I find a d-wave superconducting state that is unique close to
half-filling. The order parameter undergoes a transition to s-wave
superconductivity on increasing filling. I explain how the inclusion of both
vertex corrections and spatial fluctuations is essential for the prediction of
a d-wave order parameter. I then discuss the effects of a large Coulomb
pseudopotential on the superconductivity (such as is found in contemporary
superconducting materials like the cuprates), which results in the destruction
of the s-wave states, while leaving the d-wave states unmodified.

"A Finite Element framework for computation of protein normal modes and
  mechanical response",Mark Bathe,"  A coarse-grained computational procedure based on the Finite Element Method
is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins
and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,
proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume
defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element
representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that
facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial
resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of
T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler
buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare
favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks
procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational
framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,
including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is
equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to
electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular
assemblies of unknown atomic structure.

amount of heavy element without contradiction to CMB and light element
observations.

"Sum-over-states vs quasiparticle pictures of coherent correlation
  spectroscopy of excitons in semiconductors; femtosecond analogues of
  multidimensional NMR","Shaul Mukamel, Rafal Oszwaldowski, Darius Abramavicius","  Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCS) based on the nonlinear
optical response of excitons to sequences of ultrafast pulses, has the
potential to provide some unique insights into carrier dynamics in
semiconductors. The most prominent feature of 2DCS, cross peaks, can best be
understood using a sum-over-states picture involving the many-body eigenstates.
However, the optical response of semiconductors is usually calculated by
solving truncated equations of motion for dynamical variables, which result in
a quasiparticle picture. In this work we derive Green's function expressions
for the four wave mixing signals generated in various phase-matching directions
and use them to establish the connection between the two pictures. The formal
connection with Frenkel excitons (hard-core bosons) and vibrational excitons
(soft-core bosons) is pointed out.

"Are constant loop widths an artifact of the background and the spatial
  resolution?","M.C. Lopez Fuentes, P. Demoulin, J.A. Klimchuk","  We study the effect of the coronal background in the determination of the
diameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed
in a previous paper (L\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\'emoulin 2006) for
characterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different
synthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with
the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these
loops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the
results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows
us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

"Polarizations of J/psi and psi(2S) Mesons Produced in ppbar Collisions
  at 1.96 TeV",CDF Collaboration,"  We have measured the polarizations of $\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons as
functions of their transverse momentum $\pt$ when they are produced promptly in
the rapidity range $|y|<0.6$ with $\pt \geq 5 \pgev$. The analysis is performed
using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about $800 \ipb$ collected
by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations
become increasingly longitudinal as $\pt$ increases from 5 to $30 \pgev$. These
results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum
chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of
$\jpsi$ and $\psiprime$ mesons from $B$-hadron decays are also reported.

A measure of the non-Gaussian character of a quantum state,"Marco G. Genoni, Matteo G. A. Paris, Konrad Banaszek","  We address the issue of quantifying the non-Gaussian character of a bosonic
quantum state and introduce a non-Gaussianity measure based on the
Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the state under examination and a reference
Gaussian state. We analyze in details the properties of the proposed measure
and exploit it to evaluate the non-Gaussianity of some relevant single- and
multi-mode quantum states. The evolution of non-Gaussianity is also analyzed
for quantum states undergoing the processes of Gaussification by loss and
de-Gaussification by photon-subtraction. The suggested measure is easily
computable for any state of a bosonic system and allows to define a
corresponding measure for the non-Gaussian character of a quantum operation.

Quantum engineering of photon states with entangled atomic ensembles,"D. Porras, J.I. Cirac","  We propose and analyze a new method to produce single and entangled photons

ensembles. Light emission is triggered by a laser pulse, and therefore our
scheme is deterministic. Furthermore, it allows one to produce a variety of
photonic entangled states by first preparing certain atomic states using simple
sequences of quantum gates. We analyze the feasibility of our scheme, and
particularize it to: ions in linear traps, atoms in optical lattices, and in
cells at room temperature.

Mapping the Youngest Galaxies to Redshift One,"Yuko Kakazu, Lennox L. Cowie, and Esther M. Hu (Univ. of Hawaii, Inst.
  for Astronomy)","  We describe results of a narrow band search for ultra-strong emission line
galaxies (USELs) with EW(H beta) > 30 A. 542 candidate galaxies are found in a
half square degree survey using two ~100 Angstrom 8150 A and 9140 A filters
with Subaru/SuprimeCam. Followup spectroscopy for randomly selected objects in
the sample with KeckII/DEIMOS shows they consist of [OIII] 5007, [OII] 3727,
and H alpha selected strong-emission line galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z
< 1), and Ly alpha emitting galaxies at high-redshift (z >> 5). We determine
the H beta luminosity functions and the star formation density of the USELs,
which is 5-10% of the value found from ultraviolet continuum objects at z=0-1,
suggesting they correspond to a major epoch in galaxy formation at these
redshifts. Many USELs show the temperature-sensitive [OIII] 4363 auroral lines
and about a dozen have oxygen abundances characteristic of eXtremely Metal Poor
Galaxies (XMPGs). These XMPGs are the most distant known today. Our high yield
rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.
The lowest metallicity measured in our sample is 12+log(O/H) = 7.06
(6.78-7.44), close to the minimum metallicity found in local galaxies. The
luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent
with the strong emitters being start-up intermediate mass galaxies and suggest
that galaxies are still forming in relatively chemically pristine sites at z <
1.

On the HOMFLY and Tutte polynomials,Iain Moffatt,"  A celebrated result of F. Jaeger states that the Tutte polynomial of a planar

We show that the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot is determined by Tutte polynomials
of plane graphs associated to the knot.

Discovery of extreme asymmetry in the debris disk surrounding HD 15115,"Paul Kalas, Michael P. Fitzgerald and James R. Graham (University of
  California, Berkeley)","  We report the first scattered light detection of a dusty debris disk
surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the
optical, and Keck adaptive optics in the near-infrared. The most remarkable
property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme
length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,
whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to
near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain
scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a
large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in
the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics
alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical
perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115
that shares a common proper motion vector, heliocentric distance, galactic
space velocity, and age.

The Mathematical Universe,Max Tegmark (MIT),"  I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that
there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans.
I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies
the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an
abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and
MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible
representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to
broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness.
I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures
exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why
our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation
between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical
systems.

Testing String Theory with CMB,Renata Kallosh and Andrei Linde,"  Future detection/non-detection of tensor modes from inflation in CMB
observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.
"
Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model,Kaushik Majumdar,"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

Coherent macroscopic quantum tunneling in boson-fermion mixtures,"D. Mozyrsky, I. Martin, E. Timmermans","  We show that the cold atom systems of simultaneously trapped Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC's) and quantum degenerate fermionic atoms provide promising
laboratories for the study of macroscopic quantum tunneling. Our theoretical
studies reveal that the spatial extent of a small trapped BEC immersed in a
Fermi sea can tunnel and coherently oscillate between the values of the

transition of BEC-fermion systems). We evaluate the period, amplitude and
dissipation rate for $^{23}$Na and $^{40}$K-atoms and we discuss the
experimental prospects for observing this phenomenon.

Efficiency of thin film photocells,D. Mozyrsky and I. Martin,"  We propose a new concept for the design of high-efficiency photocells based

which maximize the efficiency of such photovoltaic element.

Galactic Wind Signatures around High Redshift Galaxies,"Daisuke Kawata (1,2), Michael Rauch (1) ((1) Carnegie Observatories,
  (2) Swinburne)","  We carry out cosmological chemodynamical simulations with different strengths
of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

  Jahnke","  We search for galaxy counterparts to damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) at
z>2 towards nine quasars, which have 14 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in their spectra.
We use integral field spectroscopy to search for Ly-alpha emission line objects
at the redshifts of the absorption systems. Besides recovering two previously
confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha
emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths
close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In
comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the
candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets
between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact
parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found
at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the
QSO line of sight to the location of the candidate emission line, we find that
the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an
exponential scale length of ~5 kpc.

catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS
Stripe 82, and contains 58 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz
system for 1.4 million unresolved sources. In each photometric bandpass we
compute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and
study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter
than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g
and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)
quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted
flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar
locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like
behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo
substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to
expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that
it will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million
low-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

"The Boundary Conditions of the Heliosphere: Photoionization Models
  Constrained by Interstellar and In Situ Data",Jonathan D. Slavin and Priscilla C. Frisch,"  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density
and composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties
of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative
transfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation
field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray
background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and
the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible
range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to
radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the
heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to
constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the
observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)
and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron
density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-
0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with
sub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however
C is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and
partially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and
X(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are
found for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low
values for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.

Long Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors: Boundary Conditions and Binary Models,"E.P.J. van den Heuvel, S.-C. Yoon","  The observed association of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with peculiar Type
Ic supernovae gives support to Woosley`s collapsar/hypernova model, in which
the GRB is produced by the collapse of the rapidly rotating core of a massive
star to a black hole. The association of LGRBs with small star-forming galaxies
suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the
collapsar stage. Both completely-mixed single star models and binary star
models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive
helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during
core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few
millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent
evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the
strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain
sufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.

"Multiscale model of electronic behavior and localization in stretched
  dry DNA","Ryan Barnett, Paul Maragakis, Ari Turner, Maria Fyta, Efthimios
  Kaxiras","  When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretch
elastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. These
distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.

Ample subvarieties and rationally connected fibrations,"Mauro C. Beltrametti, Tommaso de Fernex, Antonio Lanteri","  Under some positivity assumptions, extension properties of rationally
connected fibrations from a submanifold to its ambient variety are studied.
Given a family of rational curves on a complex projective manifold X inducing a
covering family on a submanifold Y with ample normal bundle in X, the main
results relate, under suitable conditions, the associated rational connected
fiber structures on X and on Y. Applications of these results include an
extension theorem for Mori contractions of fiber type and a classification
theorem in the case Y has a structure of projective bundle or quadric
fibration.

Decoherence of Quantum-Enhanced Timing Accuracy,Mankei Tsang (California Institute of Technology),"  Quantum enhancement of optical pulse timing accuracy is investigated in the
Heisenberg picture. Effects of optical loss, group-velocity dispersion, and
Kerr nonlinearity on the position and momentum of an optical pulse are studied
via Heisenberg equations of motion. Using the developed formalism, the impact
of decoherence by optical loss on the use of adiabatic soliton control for
beating the timing standard quantum limit [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 023902
(2006)] is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The analysis shows that an
appreciable enhancement can be achieved using current technology, despite an
increase in timing jitter mainly due to the Gordon-Haus effect. The decoherence
effect of optical loss on the transmission of quantum-enhanced timing
information is also studied, in order to identify situations in which the
enhancement is able to survive.

Stock market return distributions: from past to present,"S. Drozdz, M. Forczek, J. Kwapien, P. Oswiecimka, R. Rak","  We show that recent stock market fluctuations are characterized by the
cumulative distributions whose tails on short, minute time scales exhibit power
scaling with the scaling index alpha > 3 and this index tends to increase
quickly with decreasing sampling frequency. Our study is based on
high-frequency recordings of the S&P500, DAX and WIG20 indices over the
interval May 2004 - May 2006. Our findings suggest that dynamics of the
contemporary market may differ from the one observed in the past. This effect
indicates a constantly increasing efficiency of world markets.

radial data in all dimensions $(n\geq 5)$. We show the global well-posedness
and scattering results in the energy space. The new ingredient in this paper is
that we first take advantage of the term $\displaystyle - \int_{I}\int_{|x|\leq
A|I|^{1/2}}|u|^{2}\Delta \Big(\frac{1}{|x|}\Big)dxdt$ in the localized Morawetz
identity to rule out the possibility of energy concentration, instead of the

String inspired explanation for the super-acceleration of our universe,"Ahmad Sheykhi, Bin Wang and Nematollah Riazi","  We investigate the effect of the bulk content in the general Gauss-Bonnet

describe the super-acceleration of our universe with the equation of state of
the effective dark energy in agreement with observations.

Topological Free Entropy Dimension of in Unital C^*-algebras,Don Hadwin and Junhao Shen,"  The notion of topological free entropy dimension of $n-$tuples of elements in
a unital C$^*$ algebra was introduced by Voiculescu. In the paper, we compute
topological free entropy dimension of one self-adjoint element and topological
orbit dimension of one self-adjoint element in a unital C$^*$ algebra.
Moreover, we calculate the values of topological free entropy dimensions of
families of generators of some unital C$^*$ algebras (for example: irrational
rotation C$^*$ algebras or minimal tensor product of two reduced C$^*$ algebras
of free groups).
"
J/psi Production in an Equilibrating Partonic System,Xiao-Ming xu,"  Any color singlet or octet ccbar pair is created at short distances and then
expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included
here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of
transverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and
LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the
partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a
bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and
the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon
collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an
indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the
rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be
-3<y<3.

$f_1$ deduced from the measured polarization transfer observables indicate that
the spin--dipole resonance at $E_x \simeq 7 {\rm MeV}$ has greater $2^-$
strength than $1^-$ strength, which is consistent with recent experimental and
theoretical studies. The results also indicate a predominance of the spin-flip
and unnatural-parity transition strength in the continuum. The exchange tensor
interaction at a large momentum transfer of $Q \simeq 3.6 {\rm fm}^{-1}$ is
discussed.

Learning from compressed observations,Maxim Raginsky,"  The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random
variable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an
i.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable
predictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach
asymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the
class. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the
$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some
finite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the
$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,
the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we
give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor
performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are
illustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.
"
Hamiltonian formalism in Friedmann cosmology and its quantization,"Jie Ren, Xin-He Meng, Liu Zhao","  We propose a Hamiltonian formalism for a generalized
Friedmann-Roberson-Walker cosmology model in the presence of both a variable
equation of state (EOS) parameter $w(a)$ and a variable cosmological constant
$\Lambda(a)$, where $a$ is the scale factor. This Hamiltonian system containing
1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the
equation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass
object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the
scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant
mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$
cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds
to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into
account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized
straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.

"Optimal stimulus and noise distributions for information transmission
  via suprathreshold stochastic resonance","Mark D. McDonnell, Nigel G. Stocks and Derek Abbott","  Suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) is a form of noise enhanced signal
transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational
neuroscience and electronics.

Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment within Dark Matter Halos,"A. Faltenbacher, Cheng Li, Shude Mao, Frank C. van den Bosch, Xiaohu
  Yang, Y.P. Jing, Anna Pasquali, H.J. Mo","  Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment
within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group
galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment
between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its
BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its
satellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies
are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7
Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the
direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are
perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \Rvir, we
find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites
and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.

"Proto-Neutron Star Winds, Magnetar Birth, and Gamma-Ray Bursts","B.D. Metzger, T.A. Thompson, E. Quataert","  We begin by reviewing the theory of thermal, neutrino-driven proto-neutron
star (PNS) winds. Including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, we
then derive the mass and energy loss from magnetically-driven PNS winds for
both relativistic and non-relativistic outflows, including important
multi-dimensional considerations. With these simple analytic scalings we argue
that proto-magnetars born with ~ millisecond rotation periods produce
relativistic winds just a few seconds after core collapse with luminosities,
timescales, mass-loading, and internal shock efficiencies favorable for
producing long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

A very massive runaway star from Cygnus OB2,F. Comeron and A. Pasquali,"  Aims: We analyze the available information on the star BD+43 3654 to
investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

of the radial velocities measured from spectral features of different

"Generation of Large Number-Path Entanglement Using Linear Optics and
  Feed-Forward",Hugo Cable and Jonathan P. Dowling,"  We show how an idealised measurement procedure can condense photons from two
modes into one, and how, by feeding forward the results of the measurement, it
is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only
one mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basic
procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\""{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include
quantum imaging and metrology.

Finite branch solutions to Painleve VI around a fixed singular point,Katsunori Iwasaki,"  Every finite branch solutions to the sixth Painleve equation around a fixed
singular point is an algebraic branch solution. In particular a global solution
is an algebraic solution if and only if it is finitely many-valued globally.
The proof of this result relies on algebraic geometry of Painleve VI,
Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, geometry and dynamics on cubic surfaces,
resolutions of Kleinian singularities, and power geometry of algebraic
differential equations. In the course of the proof we are also able to classify
all finite branch solutions up to Backlund transformations.

"An Inverse $f(R)$ Gravitation for Cosmic Speed up, and Dark Energy
  Equivalent","Sohrab Rahvar, Yousef Sobouti","  To explain the cosmic speed up, brought to light by the recent SNIa and CMB
observations, we propose the following: a) In a spacetime endowed with a FRW
metric, we choose an empirical scale factor that best explains the
observations. b) We assume a modified gravity, generated by an unspecified
field lagrangian, $f(R)$. c) We use the adopted empirical scale factor to work
back retroactively to obtain $f(R)$, hence the term `Inverse $f(R)$'. d) Next
we consider the classic GR and a conventional FRW universe that, in addition to
its known baryonic content, possesses a hypothetical `Dark Energy' component.
We compare the two scenarios, and find the density, the pressure, and the
equation of the state of the Dark Energy required to make up for the
differences between the conventional and the modified GR models.

"Monitoring spatially heterogeneous dynamics in a drying colloidal thin
  film",P. Zakharov and F. Scheffold,"  We report on a new type of experiment that enables us to monitor spatially
and temporally heterogeneous dynamic properties in complex fluids. Our approach
is based on the analysis of near-field speckles produced by light diffusely
reflected from the superficial volume of a strongly scattering medium. By
periodic modulation of an incident speckle beam we obtain pixel-wise ensemble
averages of the structure function coefficient, a measure of the dynamic
activity. To illustrate the application of our approach we follow the different
stages in the drying process of a colloidal thin film. We show that we can
access ensemble averaged dynamic properties on length scales as small as ten
micrometers over the full field of view.

to understand how these envelopes are formed and evolve. The SiO maser emission
occurs at a few stellar radii from the central star, providing direct
information on the stellar pulsation and on the chemical and physical
properties of these regions. Our data also shed light on several aspects of the
SiO maser pumping theory that are not well understood yet. We aim to determine}
the relative spatial distribution of the 43 GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in
the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo. We have imaged with milliarcsecond
resolution, by means of Very Long Baseline Interferometry, the 43 GHz (28SiO
v=1, 2 J=1-0 and 29SiO v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz (28SiO v=1 J=2-1 and 29SiO v=0
J=2-1) masing regions. We confirm previous results obtained in other
oxygen-rich envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting
regions, the 28SiO v=2 transition is produced in an inner layer, closer to the
central star. On the other hand, the 86 GHz line arises in a clearly farther
shell. We have also mapped for the first time the 29SiO v=0 J=1-0 emission in R
Leo. The already reported discrepancy between the observed distributions of the
different maser lines and the theoretical predictions is also found in R Leo.

Partially disordered state near ferromagnetic transition in MnSi,S.V. Maleyev S.V. Grigoriev,"  The polarized neutron scattering in helimagnetic MnSi at low $T$ reveals
existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the
magnetic field applied along $<111>$ axis below the first order transition to
the non-chiral ferromagnetic state. This unexpected phenomenon is explained by
the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the
spin-wave gap becomes negative under magnetic field applied along $<111>$ and
$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition
between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign
means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a
destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state
below the first order ferromagnetic transition.

Fluctuations in glassy systems,Claudio Chamon and Leticia F. Cugliandolo,"  We summarize a theoretical framework based on global time-reparametrization
invariance that explains the origin of dynamic fluctuations in glassy systems.
We introduce the main ideas without getting into much technical details. We
describe a number of consequences arising from this scenario that can be tested
numerically and experimentally distinguishing those that can also be explained
by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal.
We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d

apply to super-cooled liquids that have been studied in much more detail up to
present.

Statistical analysis of weighted networks,"Antoniou Ioannis, Tsompa Eleni","  The purpose of this paper is to assess the statistical characterization of
weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters,
namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.
Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit
straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several
different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the
different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between
them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the
weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of
the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm
of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study
revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative
perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted
graphs.

"Strong Spherical Asymptotics for Rotor-Router Aggregation and the
  Divisible Sandpile",Lionel Levine and Yuval Peres,"  The rotor-router model is a deterministic analogue of random walk. It can be
used to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove
that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which
is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$
sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that
the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the
outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related
model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a
Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total
mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi
r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the
outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne
and Rossin. Similar bounds apply in higher dimensions.

power-law fitting $\nu_{1}=a(\nu_{2}/1000)^{b}$ and linear fitting
$\nu_{2}=A\nu_{1}+B$ are applied, individually, to the data points of four Z

0614+09, 4U 1608-52, 4U 1636-53 and 4U 1728-34). The $\chi^{2}$-tests show that

Moreover, the comparisons between the data and the theoretical models for kHz

Fuzzballs with internal excitations,"Ingmar Kanitscheider, Kostas Skenderis and Marika Taylor","  We construct general 2-charge D1-D5 horizon-free non-singular solutions of
IIB supergravity on T^4 and K3 describing fuzzballs with excitations in the
internal manifold; these excitations are characterized by arbitrary curves. The
solutions are obtained via dualities from F1-P solutions of heterotic and type
IIB on T^4 for the K3 and T^4 cases, respectively. We compute the holographic
data encoded in these solutions, and show that the internal excitations are
captured by vevs of chiral primaries associated with the middle cohomology of
T^4 or K3. We argue that each geometry is dual to a specific superposition of R
ground states determined in terms of the Fourier coefficients of the curves
defining the supergravity solution. We compute vevs of chiral primaries
associated with the middle cohomology and show that they indeed acquire vevs in
the superpositions corresponding to fuzzballs with internal excitations, in
accordance with the holographic results. We also address the question of
whether the fuzzball program can be implemented consistently within
supergravity.

into account the invariance to translations and spin reversal, the HO algebra
results in invariance properties of several specific correlation functions. The
use of these properties allows rigorous derivation and simplification of the
expressions of the frequency matrix (FM) and of the generalized mean field

  For the normal singlet hopping and anomalous exchange pairing correlation
functions which enter the FM and GMFA-GFs, an approximation procedure based on
the identification and elimination of exponentially small quantities is
described. It secures the reduction of the correlation order to GMFA-GF
expressions.

Geometry Effects at Atomic-Size Aluminium Contacts,Udo Schwingenschloegl and Cosima Schuster,"  We present electronic structure calculations for aluminium nanocontacts.
Addressing the neck of the contact, we compare characteristic geometries to
investigate the effects of the local aluminium coordination on the electronic

of the orbital overlap, which has serious consequences for the transport
properties. Stretching of the contact shifts states towards the Fermi energy,
leaving the system instable against ferromagnetic ordering. By spacial
restriction, hybridization is locally suppressed at nanocontacts and the charge
neutrality is violated. We discuss the influence of mechanical stress by means
of quantitative results for the charge transfer.

Photon splitting in a laser field,"A. Di Piazza, A. I. Milstein and C. H. Keitel","  Photon splitting due to vacuum polarization in a laser field is considered.
Using an operator technique, we derive the amplitudes for arbitrary strength,
spectral content and polarization of the laser field. The case of a
monochromatic circularly polarized laser field is studied in detail and the
amplitudes are obtained as three-fold integrals. The asymptotic behavior of the
amplitudes for various limits of interest are investigated also in the case of
a linearly polarized laser field. Using the obtained results, the possibility
of experimental observation of the process is discussed.

"Phonon instability and structural phase transition in Vanadium under
  high pressure",Ashok K. Verma and P. Modak,"  Results of the first-principles calculations are presented for the group-VB
metals V, Nb and Ta up to couple of megabar pressure. An unique structural
phase transition sequence BCC-->(at 60 GPa) rhombohedral (angle=110.5
degree)-->(at ~ 160 GPa)rhombohedral(angle=108.5 degree)--> (at ~ 430 GPa) BCC
is predicted in V. We also find that BCC-V becomes mechanically and
vibrationally unstable at around 112 GPa pressure. Similar transitions are
absent in Nb and Ta.

CP violation due to multi Froggatt-Nielsen fields,"Shinya Kanemura, Koichi Matsuda, Toshihiko Ota, Serguey Petcov, Tetsuo
  Shindou, Eiichi Takasugi and Koji Tsumura","  We study how to incorporate CP violation in the Froggatt--Nielsen (FN)
mechanism. To this end, we introduce non-renormalizable interactions with a
flavor democratic structure to the fermion mass generation sector. It is found
that at least two iso-singlet scalar fields with imposed a discrete symmetry
are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative
phase between their vacuum expectation values.
  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation
values R=|R|e^{i*alpha} (a magnitude and a phase). It is demonstrated how the
angles phi_i (i=1--3) of the unitarity triangle and the CKM off-diagonal
elements |V_{ub}| and |V_{cb}| are predicted as a function of |V_{us}|, |R| and
\alpha. Although the predicted value of the CP violating phase does not agree
with the experimental data within the simplest model, the basic idea of our
scenario would be promising to construct a more realistic model of flavor and
CP violation.

Rigorous Results for the Periodic Oscillation of an Adiabatic Piston,Paul Wright,"  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston
separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit
mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging
techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.
  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons
separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of
averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging
results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem
for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.

  Battin-Leclerc (DCPR), Ren\'e Fournet (DCPR), Paul-Marie Marquaire (DCPR)","  The thermal decomposition of norbornane (dissolved in benzene) has been
studied in a jet stirred reactor at temperatures between 873 and 973 K, at

  Ruiz-Lopez (SRSMC), Ren\'e Fournet (DCPR)","  This work reports a theoretical study of the gas phase unimolecular
decomposition of cyclobutane, cyclopentane and cyclohexane by means of quantum
chemical calculations. A biradical mechanism has been envisaged for each
cycloalkane, and the main routes for the decomposition of the biradicals formed
have been investigated at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. Thermochemical data
(\delta H^0_f, S^0, C^0_p) for all the involved species have been obtained by
means of isodesmic reactions. The contribution of hindered rotors has also been
included. Activation barriers of each reaction have been analyzed to assess the
1 energetically most favorable pathways for the decomposition of biradicals.
Rate constants have been derived for all elementary reactions using transition
state theory at 1 atm and temperatures ranging from 600 to 2000 K. Global rate
constant for the decomposition of the cyclic alkanes in molecular products have
been calculated. Comparison between calculated and experimental results allowed
to validate the theoretical approach. An important result is that the
rotational barriers between the conformers, which are usually neglected, are of
importance in decomposition rate of the largest biradicals. Ring strain
energies (RSE) in transition states for ring opening have been estimated and
show that the main part of RSE contained in the cyclic reactants is removed
upon the activation process.

  materials","Sebastien Chenais (LCFIO, LPL), Frederic Druon (LCFIO), Sebastien
  Forget (LCFIO, LPL), Francois Balembois (LCFIO), Patrick Georges (LCFIO)","  A review of theoretical and experimental studies of thermal effects in
solid-state lasers is presented, with a special focus on diode-pumped
ytterbium-doped materials. A large part of this review provides however general
information applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not to
make a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects,
but instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and give
a state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist to
measure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties of
Yb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in
Yb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the
first step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).
We will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the
thermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of
thermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context
where it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of
experimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,
we will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their
peculiarities will be pointed out.

Dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowires,Jian Wang and Jian-Sheng Wang,"  Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in
nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method.
Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in
nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase
of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that
the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for
diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The
calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable
in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal
conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding
value in bulk materials.

"Transient behavior of surface plasmon polaritons scattered at a
  subwavelength groove","Gaetan Leveque, Olivier J. F. Martin, John Weiner","  We present a numerical study and analytical model of the optical near-field
diffracted in the vicinity of subwavelength grooves milled in silver surfaces.
The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude
dependence of the diffracted wave as a function of the groove geometry. It is
shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and
optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part
will be controlled by surface waves.

Entropic Measure and Wasserstein Diffusion,"Max-K von Renesse, Karl-Theodor Sturm","  We construct a new random probability measure on the sphere and on the unit
interval which in both cases has a Gibbs structure with the relative entropy
functional as Hamiltonian. It satisfies a quasi-invariance formula with respect
to the action of smooth diffeomorphism of the sphere and the interval
respectively. The associated integration by parts formula is used to construct
two classes of diffusion processes on probability measures (on the sphere or
the unit interval) by Dirichlet form methods. The first one is closely related
to Malliavin's Brownian motion on the homeomorphism group. The second one is a
probability valued stochastic perturbation of the heat flow, whose intrinsic
metric is the quadratic Wasserstein distance. It may be regarded as the
canonical diffusion process on the Wasserstein space.

"Second-Order Eikonal Corrections for A(e,e'p)","B. Van Overmeire, J. Ryckebusch","  The first-order eikonal approximation is frequently adopted in interpreting
the results of $A(e,e'p)$ measurements. Glauber calculations, for example,
typically adopt the first-order eikonal approximation. We present an extension
of the relativistic eikonal approach to $A(e,e'p)$ which accounts for
second-order eikonal corrections. The numerical calculations are performed
within the relativistic optical model eikonal approximation. The nuclear
transparency results indicate that the effect of the second-order eikonal
corrections is rather modest, even at $Q^{2} \approx 0.2$ (GeV/c)$^2$. The same
applies to polarization observables, left-right asymmetries, and differential
cross sections at low missing momenta. At high missing momenta, however, the
second-order eikonal corrections are significant and bring the calculations in
closer agreement with the data and/or the exact results from models adopting
partial-wave expansions.

  Murakami","  We present a serendipitous detection of the infrared-bright supernova remnant
(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)
onboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four
observed IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,
optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative
SNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared
waveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the
infrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible
contributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged
SNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our
results highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,
especially for diagnosing SNR shocks.

"Flory-Huggins theory for the solubility of heterogeneously-modified
  polymers",Patrick B. Warren,"  Many water soluble polymers are chemically modified versions of insoluble
base materials such as cellulose. A Flory-Huggins model is solved to determine
the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such
polymers. It is found that heterogeneity leads to decreased solubility, with
the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme
blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a
polymer-polymer demixing transition. Some consequences are discussed for the
synthesis of partially modified polymers, and the experimental characterisation
of such systems.

"On second order shape optimization methods for electrical impedance
  tomography","Lekbir Afraites (LMAC), Marc Dambrine (LMAC), Djalil Kateb (LMAC)","  This paper is devoted to the analysis of a second order method for recovering
the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.

"Braiding transformation, entanglement swapping and Berry phase in

quantum entanglement, by using the unitary braiding operators to realize
entanglement swapping and generate the GHZ states as well as the linear cluster
states. A Hamiltonian is constructed from the unitary
$\check{R}_{i,i+1}(\theta,\phi)$-matrix, where $\phi=\omega t$ is
time-dependent while $\theta$ is time-independent. This in turn allows us to
investigate the Berry phase in the entanglement space.

Two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential: O(q^4) chiral expansion,S. Ishikawa and M.R. Robilotta,"  We present the expansion of the two-pion exchange three-nucleon potential
(TPE-3NP) to chiral order q^4, which corresponds to a subset of all
possibilities at this order and is based on the \piN amplitude at O(q^3).
Results encompass both numerical corrections to strength coefficients of
previous O(q^3) terms and new structures in the profile functions. The former
are typically smaller than 10% whereas the latter arise from either loop
functions or non-local gradients acting on the wave function. The influence of
the new TPE-3NP over static and scattering three-body observables has been
assessed and found to be small, as expected from perturbative corrections.

"Interference effects in above-threshold ionization from diatomic
  molecules: determining the internuclear separation","H. Hetzheim, C. Figueira de Morisson Faria, and W. Becker","  We calculate angle-resolved above-threshold ionization spectra for diatomic
molecules in linearly polarized laser fields, employing the strong-field
approximation. The interference structure resulting from the individual
contributions of the different scattering scenarios is discussed in detail,
with respect to the dependence on the internuclear distance and molecular
orientation. We show that, in general, the contributions from the processes in
which the electron is freed at one center and rescatters off the other obscure
the interference maxima and minima obtained from single-center processes.
However, around the boundary of the energy regions for which rescattering has a
classical counterpart, such processes play a negligible role and very clear
interference patterns are observed. In such energy regions, one is able to
infer the internuclear distance from the energy difference between adjacent
interference minima.

Maximum solutions of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds,"Fuquan Fang, Yuguang Zhang, Zhenlei Zhang","  We consider maximum solution $g(t)$, $t\in [0, +\infty)$, to the normalized

$g(t),t\in[0,\infty)$, be a solution to (1.3) on $M$ whose Ricci curvature
satisfies that $|\text{Ric}(g(t))|\leq 3$ and additionally $\chi(M)=3 \tau

"Phase separation and flux quantization in the doped quantum dimer model
  on the square and triangular lattices","A. Ralko, F. Mila, and D. Poilblanc","  The doped two-dimensional quantum dimer model is investigated by numerical
techniques on the square and triangular lattices, with significantly different
results. On the square lattice, at small enough doping, there is always a phase
separation between an insulating valence-bond solid and a uniform superfluid
phase, whereas on the triangular lattice, doping leads directly to a uniform
superfluid in a large portion of the RVB phase. Under an applied Aharonov-Bohm
flux, the superfluid exhibits quantization in terms of half-flux quanta,
consistent with Q=2e elementary charge quanta in transport properties.

Limit distributions and scaling functions,Christoph Richard,"  We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of models of lattice polygons, mainly on
the square lattice. In particular, we focus on limiting area laws in the
uniform perimeter ensemble where, for fixed perimeter, each polygon of a given
area occurs with the same probability. We relate limit distributions to the
scaling behaviour of the associated perimeter and area generating functions,
thereby providing a geometric interpretation of scaling functions. To a major
extent, this article is a pedagogic review of known results.

with bond-charge interaction X in addition to the usual Coulomb repulsion U at
half-filling. For large enough X and positive U the model shows three phases.
For large U the system is in the spin-density wave phase already known in the
usual Hubbard model. As U decreases, there is first a spin transition to a
spontaneously dimerized bond-ordered wave phase and then a charge transition to
a novel phase in which the dominant correlations at large distances correspond
to an incommensurate singlet superconductor.

Flavor Composition and Energy Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos,"Paolo Lipari, Maurizio Lusignoli, Davide Meloni","  The measurement of the flavor composition of the neutrino fluxes from
astrophysical sources has been proposed as a method to study not only the
nature of their emission mechanisms, but also the neutrino fundamental
properties. It is however problematic to reconcile these two goals, since a
sufficiently accurate understanding of the neutrino fluxes at the source is
needed to extract information about the physics of neutrino propagation. In
this work we discuss critically the expectations for the flavor composition and
energy spectrum from different types of astrophysical sources, and comment on
the theoretical uncertainties connected to our limited knowledge of their
structure.

Gravitational Wave Signals from Chaotic System: A Point Mass with A Disk,"Kenta Kiuchi, Hiroko Koyama, Kei-ichi Maeda","  We study gravitational waves from a particle moving around a system of a
point mass with a disk in Newtonian gravitational theory. A particle motion in
this system can be chaotic when the gravitational contribution from a surface
density of a disk is comparable with that from a point mass. In such an orbit,
we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.

"Timing evidence in determining the accretion state of the Seyfert galaxy
  NGC 3783","D.P. Summons, P. Arevalo, I.M. McHardy, P.Uttley and A.Bhaskar
  (University of Southampton)","  Previous observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) have
suggested that the power spectral density (PSD) of NGC 3783 flattens to a slope
near zero at low frequencies, in a similar manner to that of Galactic black
hole X-ray binary systems (GBHs) in the `hard' state. The low radio flux
emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

"Two- and three-point Green's functions in two-dimensional Landau-gauge
  Yang-Mills theory",Axel Maas,"  The ghost and gluon propagator and the ghost-gluon and three-gluon vertex of
two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (minimal) Landau gauge are studied
using lattice gauge theory. It is found that the results are qualitatively
similar to the ones in three and four dimensions. The propagators and the
Faddeev-Popov operator behave as expected from the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario.
In addition, finite volume effects affecting these Green's functions are
investigated systematically. The critical infrared exponents of the
propagators, as proposed in calculations using stochastic quantization and
Dyson-Schwinger equations, are confirmed quantitatively. For this purpose
lattices of volume up to (42.7 fm)^2 have been used.

"Coupled electron and phonon transport in one-dimensional atomic
  junctions","J. T. L\""u and Jian-Sheng Wang","  Employing the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we develop a fully
quantum mechanical model to study the coupled electron-phonon transport in
one-dimensional atomic junctions in the presence of a weak electron-phonon
interaction. This model enables us to study the electronic and phononic
transport on an equal footing. We derive the electrical and energy currents of
the coupled electron-phonon system and the energy exchange between them. As an
application, we study the heat dissipation in current carrying atomic junctions
within the self-consistent Born approximation, which guarantees energy current
conservation. We find that the inclusion of phonon transport is important in
determining the heat dissipation and temperature change of the atomic
junctions.

commensurability peak, and the main peak in the Fourier transform is clearly
split up due to variation in Berry's phase originating from the spin-orbit
interaction. A simulation considering Berry's phase and the phase arising from
the spin-orbit shift in the momentum space shows qualitative agreement with the
experiment.

On the dragging of light by a rotating medium,"J. B. Goette, S. M. Barnett and M. Padgett","  When light is passing through a rotating medium the optical polarisation is
rotated. Recently it has been reasoned that this rotation applies also to the
transmitted image (Padgett et al. 2006). We examine these two phenomena by
extending an analysis of Player (1976) to general electromagnetic fields. We
find that in this more general case the wave equation inside the rotating
medium has to be amended by a term which is connected to the orbital angular
momentum of the light. We show that optical spin and orbital angular momentum
account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of
the transmitted image.

Long-range correlation and multifractality in Bach's Inventions pitches,"G. R. Jafari, P. Pedram, L. Hedayatifar","  We show that it can be considered some of Bach pitches series as a stochastic
process with scaling behavior. Using multifractal deterend fluctuation analysis
(MF-DFA) method, frequency series of Bach pitches have been analyzed. In this
view we find same second moment exponents (after double profiling) in ranges
(1.7-1.8) in his works. Comparing MF-DFA results of original series to those
for shuffled and surrogate series we can distinguish multifractality due to
long-range correlations and a broad probability density function. Finally we
determine the scaling exponents and singularity spectrum. We conclude fat tail
has more effect in its multifractality nature than long-range correlations.

The First Law for Boosted Kaluza-Klein Black Holes,"David Kastor, Sourya Ray and Jennie Traschen","  We study the thermodynamics of Kaluza-Klein black holes with momentum along
the compact dimension, but vanishing angular momentum. These black holes are
stationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes and
find that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compact
direction is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADM
tension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always
positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also
derive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,
and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in
the compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived by
Traschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem
relation and give its extension in the stationary, non-rotating case.

Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance,"Hamed Haddadi, Raul Landa, Miguel Rio, Saleem Bhatti","  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

  Dapnia), T. Duguet (NSCL, Msu), J. Meyer (IPNL)","  We perform a systematic study of the impact of the J^2 tensor term in the
Skyrme energy functional on properties of spherical nuclei. In the Skyrme
energy functional, the tensor terms originate both from zero-range central and
tensor forces. We build a set of 36 parameterizations, which covers a wide
range of the parameter space of the isoscalar and isovector tensor term
coupling constants, with a fit protocol very similar to that of the successful
SLy parameterizations. We analyze the impact of the tensor terms on a large
variety of observables in spherical mean-field calculations, such as the
spin-orbit splittings and single-particle spectra of doubly-magic nuclei, the
evolution of spin-orbit splittings along chains of semi-magic nuclei, mass
residuals of spherical nuclei, and known anomalies of charge radii. Our main
conclusion is that the currently used central and spin-orbit parts of the
Skyrme energy density functional are not flexible enough to allow for the
presence of large tensor terms.

"Cosmological Singularities and a Conjectured Gravity/Coset
  Correspondence",Thibault Damour,"  We review the recently discovered connection between the
Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of generic
cosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last''
hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10). This intriguing connection suggests the
existence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or even
M-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset space
K(E(10)). If true, this gravity/coset correspondence would offer a new view of
the (quantum) fate of space (and matter) at cosmological singularities.

normally used value of f_col, the distance cannot be very small, and f_col

  quasars: The Spitzer perspective","F. Pozzi, C. Vignali, A. Comastri, L. Pozzetti, M. Mignoli, C.
  Gruppioni, G. Zamorani, C. Lari, F. Civano, M. Brusa, F. Fiore, R. Maiolino
  and F. La Franca","  Aims: We aim at estimating the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the
physical parameters related to the black holes harbored in eight high
X-ray-to-optical (F_X/F_R>10) obscured quasars at z>0.9 selected in the 2--10
keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the
range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is
~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).
For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high
stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range
(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion
phase.
"
$p$-Adic Haar multiresolution analysis,"V. M. Shelkovich, M. Skopina","  In this paper, the notion of {\em $p$-adic multiresolution analysis (MRA)} is
introduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a
refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This
equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is
the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be
intensively used for applications.

Jumping Through Loops: On Soft Terms from Large Volume Compactifications,"Marcus Berg, Michael Haack, Enrico Pajer","  We subject the phenomenologically successful large volume scenario of
hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we
consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in
the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at
tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of
soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We
also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered
Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss
further checks that need to be performed.

Driven activation versus thermal activation,Patrick Ilg and Jean-Louis Barrat,"  Activated dynamics in a glassy system undergoing steady shear deformation is
studied by numerical simulations. Our results show that the external driving
force has a strong influence on the barrier crossing rate, even though the
reaction coordinate is only weakly coupled to the nonequilibrium system. This
""driven activation"" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius
expression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from
the fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by
analytical results for a simplified model system.

Vertical dynamics of disk galaxies in MOND,"Carlo Nipoti (1), Pasquale Londrillo (2), HongSheng Zhao (3), Luca

  Andrews Univ.)","  We investigate the possibility of discriminating between Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian gravity with dark matter, by studying the
vertical dynamics of disk galaxies. We consider models with the same circular
velocity in the equatorial plane (purely baryonic disks in MOND and the same
disks in Newtonian gravity embedded in spherical dark matter haloes), and we
construct their intrinsic and projected kinematical fields by solving the Jeans
equations under the assumption of a two-integral distribution function. We
found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much
larger than in the equivalent spherical Newtonian models. However, in the more
realistic case of high-surface density disks this effect is significantly
reduced, casting doubts on the possibility of discriminating between MOND and
Newtonian gravity with dark matter by using current observations.

"Al'tshuler-Aronov correction to the conductivity of a large metallic
  square network",Christophe Texier and Gilles Montambaux,"  We consider the correction $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ due to
electron-electron interaction to the conductivity of a weakly disordered metal
(Al'tshuler-Aronov correction). The correction is related to the spectral
determinant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallic
network is considered. The variation of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a
function of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of
the weak localization $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{WL}(L_\phi)$ as a function of the
phase coherence length. Our result for $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates
between the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the
expression of $\Delta\sigma_\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour. Quite
surprisingly, the result is very close to the 2d logarithmic behaviour already
for $L_T\sim{a}/2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.

considered: the case of rings separated by long wires compared to the phase
coherence length and the case of contacted rings. In a second part we discuss
the role of decoherence due to electron-electron interaction in these two

Diatomic molecule as a quantum entanglement switch,Adam Rycerz,"  We investigate a pair entanglement of electrons in diatomic molecule, modeled

properties are derived from the ground state obtained by utilizing the
Rejec-Ramsak variational technique within the framework of EDABI method, which
combines exact diagonalization with ab initio calculations. The results show,
that single-particle basis renormalization modifies the entanglement-switch
effectiveness significantly. We also found the entanglement signature of a
competition between an extended Kondo and singlet phases.
"
Quantifying social group evolution,"Gergely Palla, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi and Tamas Vicsek","  The rich set of interactions between individuals in the society results in
complex community structure, capturing highly connected circles of friends,
families, or professional cliques in a social network. Thanks to frequent
changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the
associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.
Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm
based on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate
the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the
time commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating
the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

"Weak and Strong Taylor methods for numerical solutions of stochastic

expansions of solutions of perturbed stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
In particular, we work out weight expressions for the Taylor coefficients of
the expansion. The results are applied to LIBOR market models in order to deal
with the typical stochastic drift and with stochastic volatility. In contrast
to other accurate methods like numerical schemes for the full SDE, we obtain
easily tractable expressions for accurate pricing. In particular, we present an
easily tractable alternative to ``freezing the drift'' in LIBOR market models,
which has an accuracy similar to the full numerical scheme. Numerical examples
underline the results.

Finite bias visibility of the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer,"Preden Roulleau, F. Portier, D. C. Glattli, P. Roche, A. Cavanna, G.

interferences in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the presence of
low frequency fluctuations. The visibility presents a single side lobe
structure shown to result from a gaussian phase averaging whose variance is
quadratic with the bias. To reinforce our approach and validate our statistical
method, the same experiment is also realized with a stable sample. It exhibits
the same visibility behavior as the fluctuating one, indicating the intrinsic
character of finite bias phase averaging. In both samples, the dilution of the
impinging current reduces the variance of the gaussian distribution.

Weyl invariant models.

The dynamical Casimir effect in braneworlds,Ruth Durrer and Marcus Ruser,"  In braneworld cosmology the expanding Universe is realized as a brane moving
through a warped higher-dimensional spacetime. Like a moving mirror causes the
creation of photons out of vacuum fluctuations, a moving brane leads to
graviton production. We show that, very generically, Kaluza-Klein (KK)
particles scale like stiff matter with the expansion of the Universe and can
therefore not represent the dark matter in a warped braneworld. We present
results for the production of massless and KK gravitons for bouncing branes in
five-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that for a realistic bounce the
back reaction from the generated gravitons will be most likely relevant. This
letter summarizes the main results and conclusions from numerical simulations
which are presented in detail in a long paper [M.Ruser and R. Durrer, Phys.

Bounds on Negativity of Superpositions,Yong-Cheng Ou and Heng Fan,"  The entanglement quantified by negativity of pure bipartite superposed states
is studied. We show that if the entanglement is quantified by the concurrence
two pure states of high fidelity to one another still have nearly the same
entanglement. Furthermore this conclusion can be guaranteed by our obtained
inequality, and the concurrence is shown to be a continuous function even in
infinite dimensions. The bounds on the negativity of superposed states in terms
of those of the states being superposed are obtained. These bounds can find
useful applications in estimating the amount of the entanglement of a given
pure state.

Entangling Independent Photons by Time Measurement,"Matthaeus Halder, Alexios Beveratos, Nicolas Gisin, Valerio Scarani,
  Christoph Simon and Hugo Zbinden","  A quantum system composed of two or more subsystems can be in an entangled
state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

Energy conservation and Onsager's conjecture for the Euler equations,"A. Cheskidov, P. Constantin, S. Friedlander, R. Shvydkoy","  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for
incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate
energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for
velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the
Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by
local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to
$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.

"Search for Heavy, Long-Lived Particles that Decay to Photons at CDF II",A. Abulencia et al. (CDF Collaboration),"  We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to
photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of photon+jet+missing transverse
energy events in p-pbar collisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II
detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon
at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570 pb-1 of collision data,
we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3+-0.7
events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we
set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with
\tilde{\chi}_1^0->\gamma\gravitino and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower
limit on the \tilde{\chi}_1^0 mass of 101 GeV/c^2 at \tau_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} =

Failure of the work-Hamiltonian connection for free energy calculations,Jose M. G. Vilar and J. Miguel Rubi,"  Extensions of statistical mechanics are routinely being used to infer free
energies from the work performed over single-molecule nonequilibrium
trajectories. A key element of this approach is the ubiquitous expression
dW/dt=\partial H(x,t)/ \partial t which connects the microscopic work W
performed by a time-dependent force on the coordinate x with the corresponding
Hamiltonian H(x,t) at time t. Here we show that this connection, as pivotal as
it is, cannot be used to estimate free energy changes. We discuss the
implications of this result for single-molecule experiments and atomistic
molecular simulations and point out possible avenues to overcome these
limitations.

"Dependence of the Critical Adsorption Point on Surface and Sequence

with a planar surface with surface disorder or sequence disorder has been
studied. We present theoretical equations, based on ones previously developed
by Soteros and Whittington (J. Phys. A.: Math. Gen. 2004, 37, R279-R325), that
describe the dependence of CAP on the disorders along with Monte Carlo
simulation data that are in agreement with the equations. We also show
simulation results that deviate from the equations when the approximations used
in the theory break down. Such knowledge is the first step toward understanding
the correlation of surface disorder and sequence disorder during polymer
adsorption.
"
Coherent control of atomic tunneling,John Martin and Daniel Braun,"  We study the tunneling of a two-level atom in a double well potential while
the atom is coupled to a single electromagnetic field mode of a cavity. The
coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom, due to the
mechanical effect on the atom from photon emission into the cavity mode, can
dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the
tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a
collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of
freedom of the atom with a laser allows to coherently manipulate the atom
position, and in particular to prepare the atom in one of the two wells. The
effects described should be observable with atoms in an optical double well
trap.

are studied by means of effective field theory approaches in combination with
numerical calculations utilizing Lanczos diagonalization and the density matrix

saturation magnetization. The excitation spectrum is analyzed and the behavior
of the single spin-flip excitation gap is studied in detail, including the
emergent finite-size corrections.

thin films have been interpreted as evidence of the presence of superconducting
islands on the insulating side of a disorder-tuned superconductor-insulator
transition. Although the films are not granular, the behavior is similar to
that observed in granular films. The results support theoretical models in
which the destruction of superconductivity by disorder produces spatially
inhomogenous pairing with a spectral gap.

Local de Broglie-Bohm Trajectories from Entangled Wavefunctions,Michael Clover,"  We present a local interpretation of what is usually considered to be a
nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state
of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term
``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,
the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.

Ground-based Microlensing Surveys,"Andrew Gould (OSU), B. Scott Gaudi (OSU), David P. Bennett (Notre

Neptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing is
sensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, in
particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.
terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,
and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical
constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of
extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded
microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary
surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and
complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular
low-mass terrestrial planets.

  Max-Planck-Institut fur Sonnensystemforschung, Germany)","  NGC 7679 is a nearby luminous infrared Sy2 galaxy in which starburst and AGN
activities co-exist. The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN
power-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source
possessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}. The Compton-thin
nature of such unabsorbed objects infers that the simple formulation of the
Unified model for SyGs is not applicable in their case. The main goal of this
article is to investigate both gas distribution and ionization structure in the
circumnuclear region of NGC 7679 in search for the presence of a hidden Sy1
nucleus, using the [O III] 5007 luminosity as a tracer of AGN activity. The [O
III] 5007 image of the NGC 7679 shows elliptical isophotes extended along the
PA ~ 80 deg in the direction to the counterpart galaxy NGC 7682. The maximum of
ionization by the AGN power-law continuum traced by [O III] 5007/Halpha ratio
is displaced by ~ 13 arcsec eastward from the nucleus. We conclude that the
dust and gas in the high ionization direction has a direct view to the central
AGN engine. This possibly results in dust/star-formation decay. A large
fraction of the unabsorbed Compton-thin Sy2s with [O III] luminosity > 10^41

The Fermionic Density-functional at Feshbach Resonance,Michael Seidl and Rajat K. Bhaduri,"  We consider a dilute gas of neutral unpolarized fermionic atoms at zero
temperature.The atoms interact via a short range (tunable) attractive
interaction. We demonstrate analytically a curious property of the gas at
unitarity. Namely, the correlation energy of the gas, evaluated by second order
perturbation theory, has the same density dependence as the first order
exchange energy, and the two almost exactly cancel each other at Feshbach
resonance irrespective of the shape of the potential, provided $(\mu r_s) >>
1$. Here $(\mu)^{-1}$ is the range of the two-body potential, and $r_s$ is
defined through the number density $n=3/(4\pi r_s^3)$. The implications of this
result for universality is discussed.

Chemical Evolution,Francesca Matteucci,"  In this series of lectures we first describe the basic ingredients of
galactic chemical evolution and discuss both analytical and numerical models.
Then we compare model results for the Milky Way, Dwarf Irregulars, Quasars and
the Intra-Cluster- Medium with abundances derived from emission lines. These
comparisons allow us to put strong constraints on the stellar nucleosynthesis
and the mechanisms of galaxy formation.

Suppression of 1/f noise in one-qubit systems,"Pekko Kuopanportti, Mikko Mottonen, Ville Bergholm, Olli-Pentti Saira,
  Jun Zhang, and K. Birgitta Whaley","  We investigate the generation of quantum operations for one-qubit systems
under classical noise with 1/f^\alpha power spectrum, where 2>\alpha > 0. We
present an efficient way to approximate the noise with a discrete multi-state
Markovian fluctuator. With this method, the average temporal evolution of the
qubit density matrix under 1/f^\alpha noise can be feasibly determined from
recently derived deterministic master equations. We obtain qubit operations
such as quantum memory and the NOT}gate to high fidelity by a gradient based
optimization algorithm. For the NOT gate, the computed fidelities are
qualitatively similar to those obtained earlier for random telegraph noise. In
the case of quantum memory however, we observe a nonmonotonic dependency of the
fidelity on the operation time, yielding a natural access rate of the memory.

"Stability of a colocated finite volume scheme for the incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations",Sebastien Zimmermann,"  We introduce a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations. We use a triangular mesh. The unknowns for the
velocity and pressure are both piecewise constant (colocated scheme). We use a
projection (fractional-step) method to deal with the incompressibility
constraint. We prove that the differential operators in the Navier-Stokes
equations and their discrete counterparts share similar properties. In
particular, we state an inf-sup (Babuska-Brezzi) condition. We infer from it
the stability of the scheme.
"
Collective behavior of stock price movements in an emerging market,Raj Kumar Pan and Sitabhra Sinha,"  To investigate the universality of the structure of interactions in different
markets, we analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price fluctuations
in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. We find that this emerging
market exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to
developed markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to
be due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.
By comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to
the same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector
identity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network
of mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,
the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.

"Galaxy morphologies and environment in the Abell 901/902 supercluster
  from COMBO-17","K. P. Lane, M. E. Gray, A. Aragon-Salamanca, C. Wolf and K.
  Meisenheimer","  We present a morphological study of galaxies in the A901/902 supercluster
from the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in
the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent
classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to
local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription
of Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes
an intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,
supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed
into S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.

K_0-theory of n-potents in rings and algebras,Efton Park and Jody Trout,"  Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. An \emph{$n$-potent} is an element $e$ of a
ring $R$ such that $e^n = e$. In this paper, we study $n$-potents in matrices
over $R$ and use them to construct an abelian group $K_0^n(R)$. If $A$ is a
complex algebra, there is a group isomorphism $K_0^n(A) \cong
\bigl(K_0(A)\bigr)^{n-1}$ for all $n \geq 2$. However, for algebras over
cyclotomic fields, this is not true in general. We consider $K_0^n$ as a
covariant functor, and show that it is also functorial for a generalization of
homomorphism called an \emph{$n$-homomorphism}.

Spin coupling in zigzag Wigner crystals,"A. D. Klironomos, Julia S. Meyer, T. Hikihara, K. A. Matveev","  We consider interacting electrons in a quantum wire in the case of a shallow
confining potential and low electron density. In a certain range of densities,
the electrons form a two-row (zigzag) Wigner crystal whose spin properties are
determined by nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchange as well as by three-
and four-particle ring exchange processes. The phase diagram of the resulting
zigzag spin chain has regions of complete spin polarization and partial spin
polarization in addition to a number of unpolarized phases, including
antiferromagnetism and dimer order as well as a novel phase generated by the
four-particle ring exchange.
"
Decoupling Supergravity from the Superstring,"Michael B. Green, Hirosi Ooguri, and John H. Schwarz","  We consider the conditions necessary for obtaining perturbative maximal
supergravity in d dimensions as a decoupling limit of type II superstring
theory compactified on a (10 -- d)-torus. For dimensions d = 2 and d = 3 it is
possible to define a limit in which the only finite-mass states are the 256
massless states of maximal supergravity. However, in dimensions d > 3 there are
infinite towers of additional massless and finite-mass states. These correspond
to Kaluza--Klein charges, wound strings, Kaluza--Klein monopoles or branes
wrapping around cycles of the toroidal extra dimensions. We conclude that
perturbative supergravity cannot be decoupled from string theory in dimensions
d > 3. In particular, we conjecture that pure N = 8 supergravity in four
dimensions is in the Swampland.
"
Frobenius splitting and geometry of $G$-Schubert varieties,Xuhua He and Jesper Funch Thomsen,"  Let $X$ be an equivariant embedding of a connected reductive group $G$ over
an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic. Let $B$ denote a
Borel subgroup of $G$. A $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ is a subvariety of the
form $\diag(G) \cdot V$, where $V$ is a $B \times B$-orbit closure in $X$. In
the case where $X$ is the wonderful compactification of a group of adjoint
type, the $G$-Schubert varieties are the closures of Lusztig's $G$-stable
pieces. We prove that $X$ admits a Frobenius splitting which is compatible with
all $G$-Schubert varieties. Moreover, when $X$ is smooth, projective and
toroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobenius
splitting along an ample divisors. Although this indicates that $G$-Schubert
varieties have nice singularities we present an example of a non-normal
$G$-Schubert variety in the wonderful compactification of a group of type
$G_2$. Finally we also extend the Frobenius splitting results to the more
general class of $\mathcal R$-Schubert varieties.

"High Energy Variability Of Synchrotron-Self Compton Emitting Sources:
  Why One Zone Models Do Not Work And How We Can Fix It","Philip B. Graff, Markos Georganopoulos, Eric S. Perlman, Demosthenes
  Kazanas","  With the anticipated launch of GLAST, the existing X-ray telescopes, and the
enhanced capabilities of the new generation of TeV telescopes, developing tools
for modeling the variability of high energy sources such as blazars is becoming
a high priority. We point out the serious, innate problems one zone
synchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. We
then present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, time
delayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.
By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our
code can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation
typical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce
variability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeV
flares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.

  Y. Larochelle, W. Loveland, D. Peterson","  Evaporation residue and fission cross sections of radioactive $^{132}$Sn on
$^{64}$Ni were measured near the Coulomb barrier. A large sub-barrier fusion
enhancement was observed. Coupled-channel calculations including inelastic
excitation of the projectile and target, and neutron transfer are in good
agreement with the measured fusion excitation function. When the change in
nuclear size and shift in barrier height are accounted for, there is no extra
fusion enhancement in $^{132}$Sn+$^{64}$Ni with respect to stable Sn+$^{64}$Ni.
A systematic comparison of evaporation residue cross sections for the fusion of
even $^{112-124}$Sn and $^{132}$Sn with $^{64}$Ni is presented.
"
Tri-layer superlattices: A route to magnetoelectric multiferroics?,Alison J. Hatt and Nicola A. Spaldin,"  We explore computationally the formation of tri-layer superlattices as an
alternative approach for combining ferroelectricity with magnetism to form
magnetoelectric multiferroics. We find that the contribution to the
superlattice polarization from tri-layering is small compared to typical
polarizations in conventionalferroelectrics, and the switchable ferroelectric
component is negligible. In contrast, we show that epitaxial strain and
``negative pressure'' can yield large, switchable polarizations that are
compatible with the coexistence of magnetism, even in materials with no active
ferroelectric ions.
"
Testing outer boundary treatments for the Einstein equations,"Oliver Rinne, Lee Lindblom and Mark A. Scheel","  Various methods of treating outer boundaries in numerical relativity are
compared using a simple test problem: a Schwarzschild black hole with an
outgoing gravitational wave perturbation. Numerical solutions computed using
different boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solution
obtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For each
boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and
extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These
tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein
equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are
reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the
incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the
constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather
different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial
compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here
combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the
Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.

D-brane Instantons on the T^6/Z_3 orientifold,"Massimo Bianchi, Francesco Fucito and Jose F. Morales","  We give a detailed microscopic derivation of gauge and stringy instanton
generated superpotentials for gauge theories living on D3-branes at
Z_3-orientifold singularities. Gauge instantons are generated by D(-1)-branes
and lead to Affleck, Dine and Seiberg (ADS) like superpotentials in the
effective N=1 gauge theories with three generations of bifundamental and
anti/symmetric matter. Stringy instanton effects are generated by Euclidean
ED3-branes wrapping four-cycles on T^6/\Z_3. They give rise to Majorana masses
in one case and non-renormalizable superpotentials for the other cases. Finally
we determine the conditions under which ADS like superpotentials are generated
in N=1 gauge theories with adjoints, fundamentals, symmetric and antisymmetric
chiral matter.

"Viscoplastic Properties and Tribological Behavior of Diamond-Like Carbon
  Films Using Nanoindentation and Nanoscratch Tests","Viviane Turq (LTDS), Julien Fontaine (LTDS), Jean-Luc Loubet (LTDS),
  Denis Mazuyer (LTDS)","  Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) films have been shown to demonstrate various
tribological behaviors: in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), with either friction
coefficients as low as 0.01 or less and very mild wear, or very high friction
coefficients (>0.4) and drastic wear. These behaviors depend notably on gaseous
environment, hydrogen content of the film [1], and on its viscoplastic
properties [2,3]. A relation between superlow friction in UHV and
viscoplasticity has indeed been established for a-C:H films and confirmed for a
fluorinated sample (a-C:F:H). In this study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch
tests were conducted in ambient air, using a nanoindentation apparatus, in
order to evaluate tribological behaviors, as well as mechanical and
viscoplastic properties of different amorphous carbon films.

"Implication of the D^0 Width Difference On CP-Violation in D^0-\bar D^0
  Mixing",Patricia Ball,"  Both BaBar and Belle have found evidence for a non-zero width difference in
the $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ system. Although there is no direct experimental evidence
for CP-violation in $D$ mixing (yet), we show that the measured values of the
width difference $y\sim \Delta\Gamma$ already imply constraints on the
CP-violating phase in $D$ mixing, which, if significantly different from zero,
would be an unambiguous signal of new physics.

Convergence of a finite volume scheme for the incompressible fluids,Sebastien Zimmermann,"  We consider a finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible

Optimal Synthesis of Multiple Algorithms,Kerry M. Soileau,"  In this paper we give a definition of ""algorithm,"" ""finite algorithm,""
""equivalent algorithms,"" and what it means for a single algorithm to dominate a
set of algorithms. We define a derived algorithm which may have a smaller mean
execution time than any of its component algorithms. We give an explicit
expression for the mean execution time (when it exists) of the derived
algorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with two
component algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions for
two-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of several
general forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithm
processor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation scheme
with which to analyze empirical processing time data.

close binary systems observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through Data
Release Five. We use the catalog to search for magnetic white dwarfs in
cataclysmic variable progenitor systems. Given that approximately 25% of
cataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sample
of close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmic
variables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magnetic
white dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,
would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that are
similar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the average
field strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations of
these systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.
Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magnetic
white dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between the
properties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and the
presumed close binary progenitors.

Dynamical Casimir effect for gravitons in bouncing braneworlds,Marcus Ruser and Ruth Durrer,"  We consider a two-brane system in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter
spacetime. We study particle creation due to the motion of the physical brane
which first approaches the second static brane (contraction) and then recedes
from it(expansion). The spectrum and the energy density of the generated
gravitons are calculated. We show that the massless gravitons have a blue
spectrum and that their energy density satisfies the nucleosynthesis bound with
very mild constraints on the parameters. We also show that the Kaluza-Klein
modes cannot provide the dark matter in an anti-de-Sitter braneworld. However,
for natural choices of parameters, backreaction from the Kaluza-Klein gravitons
may well become important. The main findings of this work have been published
in the form of a Letter [R. Durrer and M. Ruser, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 071601

  (2), G. Ghisellini (2), L. Nava (2,3) ((1)U.N.A.M., (2)INAF-OAB, (3)Univ.
  Insubria)","  We study the spectral and energetics properties of 47 long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our
homogeneous sample of GRBs on the rest-frame diagram E'pk vs Eiso. We confirm a
significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to
-2.3, obtaining a rather good agreement with the ""Amati"" relation of non-Swift
GRBs.

"The Relationship Between Molecular Gas Tracers and Kennicutt-Schmidt
  Laws",Mark R. Krumholz and Todd A. Thompson (Princeton University),"  We provide a model for how Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) laws, which describe the
correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

Friedmann Equations and Thermodynamics of Apparent Horizons,Yungui Gong and Anzhong Wang,"  With the help of a masslike function which has dimension of energy and equals
to the Misner-Sharp mass at the apparent horizon, we show that the first law of
thermodynamics of the apparent horizon $dE=T_AdS_A$ can be derived from the
Friedmann equation in various theories of gravity, including the Einstein,
Lovelock, nonlinear, and scalar-tensor theories. This result strongly suggests
that the relationship between the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent
horizon and the Friedmann equation is not just a simple coincidence, but rather
a more profound physical connection.

  Patrick C. McGuire (4)((1)Caltech, (2)Princeton University, (3)University of
  Wisconsin, (4)Washington University)","  Although the rocket-based X-ray Quantum Calorimetry (XQC) experiment was
designed for X-ray spectroscopy, the minimal shielding of its calorimeters, its
low atmospheric overburden, and its low-threshold detectors make it among the
most sensitive instruments for detecting or constraining strong interactions
between dark matter particles and baryons. We use Monte Carlo simulations to
obtain the precise limits the XQC experiment places on spin-independent
interactions between dark matter and baryons, improving upon earlier analytical
estimates. We find that the XQC experiment rules out a wide range of
nucleon-scattering cross sections centered around one barn for dark matter
particles with masses between 0.01 and 10^5 GeV. Our analysis also provides new
constraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly
interacts with baryons.

Heavy-Light Semileptonic Decays in Staggered Chiral Perturbation Theory,C. Aubin and C. Bernard,"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light
pseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory
(\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark
mass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar
corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered
(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially
quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of
non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the
light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.

"A density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics: retrieving the
  noise",Stephen L. Adler,"  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that
recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

"Scalar self-force on eccentric geodesics in Schwarzschild spacetime: a
  time-domain computation",Roland Haas,"  We calculate the self-force acting on a particle with scalar charge moving on
a generic geodesic around a Schwarzschild black hole. This calculation requires
an accurate computation of the retarded scalar field produced by the moving
charge; this is done numerically with the help of a fourth-order convergent
finite-difference scheme formulated in the time domain. The calculation also
requires a regularization procedure, because the retarded field is singular on
the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum
regularization scheme first introduced by Barack and Ori. This paper presents
the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for
mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.

"Nonimmersions of RP^n implied by tmf, revisited",Donald M. Davis and Mark Mahowald,"  In a 2002 paper, the authors and Bruner used the new spectrum tmf to obtain
some new nonimmersions of real projective spaces. In this note, we
complete/correct two oversights in that paper.
  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was
stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet
it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we
give a simple proof of those overlooked results.
  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was
claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently
that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication
by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion
results claimed in the original paper.
  Finally, we present a complete determination of tmf^{8*}(RP^\infty\times
RP^\infty) and tmf^*(CP^\infty\times CP^\infty) in positive dimensions.

"Spin Evolution of Accreting Neutron Stars: Nonlinear Development of the
  R-mode Instability","Ruxandra Bondarescu, Saul A. Teukolsky and Ira Wasserman (Cornell
  University)","  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the
spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

Quantum Auctions,"Tad Hogg, Pavithra Harsha and Kay-Yut Chen","  We present a quantum auction protocol using superpositions to represent bids
and distributed search to identify the winner(s). Measuring the final quantum
state gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the
superposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use
entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the
quantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a
suitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to
game the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that
computational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.

"Fundamental solutions for a class of non-elliptic homogeneous
  differential operators",Brice Camus,"  We compute temperate fundamental solutions of homogeneous differential
operators with real-principal type symbols. Via analytic continuation of
meromorphic distributions, fundamental solutions for these non-elliptic
operators can be constructed in terms of radial averages and invariant
distributions on the unit sphere.

Hybrid-ARQ in Multihop Networks with Opportunistic Relay Selection,"Caleb K. Lo, Robert W. Heath, Jr. and Sriram Vishwanath","  This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique
towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the
forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the
destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as
the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of
the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a
distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that
of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed
method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput
gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.

Geometric Phase and Superconducting Flux Quantization,Walter A. Simmons and Sandip S. Pakvasa,"  In a ring of s-wave superconducting material the magnetic flux is quantized
in units of $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$. It is well known from the theory of
Josephson junctions that if the ring is interrupted with a piece of d-wave
material, then the flux is quantized in one-half of those units due to a
additional phase shift of $\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of
geometric phase.
  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and
pure d-wave electron pairs. We find, for this idealized configuration, that the
phase shift of $\pi$ follows from the discontinuity in the geometric phase and
is thus a fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics.

Equation-free implementation of statistical moment closures,"Francis J. Alexander, Gregory Johnson, Gregory L. Eyink, and Ioannis
  G. Kevrekidis","  We present a general numerical scheme for the practical implementation of
statistical moment closures suitable for modeling complex, large-scale,
nonlinear systems. Building on recently developed equation-free methods, this
approach numerically integrates the closure dynamics, the equations of which
may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce
statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant
computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and
may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can
in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including
strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there
may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for
implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic
partial differential equation.
"
Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback,"Caleb K. Lo, Robert W. Heath, Jr. and Sriram Vishwanath","  It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.

quasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the
catalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at
redshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <
19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions
accurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)
CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the
morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,
near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,

Nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory,R. Machleidt,"  In this lecture series, I present the recent progress in our understanding of

On a Conjecture of EM Stein on the Hilbert Transform on Vector Fields,Michael Lacey and Xiaochun Li,"  Let $ v$ be a smooth vector field on the plane, that is a map from the plane
to the unit circle. We study sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the
Hilbert transform
  \operatorname H_{v, \epsilon}f(x) := \text{p.v.}\int_{-\epsilon}^ \epsilon
f(x-yv(x)) \frac{dy}y where $ \epsilon $ is a suitably chosen parameter,
determined by the smoothness properties of the vector field. It is a
conjecture, due to E.\thinspace M.\thinspace Stein, that if $ v$ is Lipschitz,
there is a positive $ \epsilon $ for which the transform above is bounded on $
L ^{2}$. Our principal result gives a sufficient condition in terms of the
boundedness of a maximal function associated to $ v$. This sufficient condition
is that this new maximal function be bounded on some $ L ^{p}$, for some $
1<p<2$. We show that the maximal function is bounded from $ L ^{2}$ to weak $ L
^{2}$ for all Lipschitz maximal function. The relationship between our results
and other known sufficient conditions is explored.
"
Wide Field Surveys and Astronomical Discovery Space,A.Lawrence,"  I review the status of science with wide field surveys. For many decades
surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,
as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an
efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to
map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

with an expected sensitivity per pixel better than 100 $\mu K / deg^2$ from 10
GHz to 20 GHz. This is an important effort toward characterizing the polarized
foregrounds for future CMB experiments, in particular the ones that aim to
detect primordial gravity wave signatures in the CMB polarization angular power
spectrum.
"
Jet interactions in massive X-ray binaries,Gustavo E. Romero,"  Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter
from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,
called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of
the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion
star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.
In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with
particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The
case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some
detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type
of objects will be presented.

The Na I D resonance lines in main sequence late-type stars,"Rodrigo F. D\'iaz, Carolina Cincunegui and Pablo J. D. Mauas
  (Instituto de Astronom\'ia y F\'isica del Espacio (IAFE). Buenos Aires,
  Argentina)","  We study the sodium D lines (D1: 5895.92 \AA; D2: 5889.95 \AA) in late-type
dwarf stars. The stars have spectral types between F6 and M5.5 (B-V between
0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained
medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian
observatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since
1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in
flux stars of unknown colour.

Photons as quasi-charged particles,"K.-P. Marzlin, Juergen Appel, A. I. Lvovsky","  The Schrodinger motion of a charged quantum particle in an electromagnetic
potential can be simulated by the paraxial dynamics of photons propagating
through a spatially inhomogeneous medium. The inhomogeneity induces geometric
effects that generate an artificial vector potential to which signal photons
are coupled. This phenomenon can be implemented with slow light propagating
through an a gas of double-Lambda atoms in an electromagnetically-induced
transparency setting with spatially varied control fields. It can lead to a
reduced dispersion of signal photons and a topological phase shift of
Aharonov-Bohm type.

"
3-D Simulations of Ergospheric Disk Driven Poynting Jets,Brian Punsly,"  This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole
magnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux
dominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the
ergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified
limit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the
ergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for
greatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux
that is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of
electromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux
threading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading
the equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central
engine of powerful FRII quasars.

"Two-scale structure of the electron dissipation region during
  collisionless magnetic reconnection","M. A. Shay, J. F. Drake, and M. Swisdak","  Particle in cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are
presented that demonstrate that the electron dissipation region develops a
distinct two-scale structure along the outflow direction. The length of the
electron current layer is found to decrease with decreasing electron mass,
approaching the ion inertial length for a proton-electron plasma. A surprise,
however, is that the electrons form a high-velocity outflow jet that remains
decoupled from the magnetic field and extends large distances downstream from
the x-line. The rate of reconnection remains fast in very large systems,
independent of boundary conditions and the mass of electrons.
"
"Position-Velocity Diagrams for the Maser Emission coming from a
  Keplerian Ring","Lucero Uscanga, Jorge Cant\'o and Alejandro C. Raga","  We have studied the maser emission from a thin, planar, gaseous ring in
Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption
coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with
the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated
position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy
NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object
the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the
inner edge of the ring.

"Coupling of whispering-gallery modes in size-mismatched microdisk
  photonic molecules",Svetlana V. Boriskina,"  Mechanisms of whispering-gallery (WG) modes coupling in microdisk photonic
molecules (PMs) with slight and significant size mismatch are numerically
investigated. The results reveal two different scenarios of modes interaction
depending on the degree of this mismatch and offer new insight into how PM
parameters can be tuned to control and modify WG-modes wavelengths and
Q-factors. From a practical point of view, these findings offer a way to
fabricate PM microlaser structures that exhibit low thresholds and directional
emission, and at the same time are more tolerant to fabrication errors than
previously explored coupled-cavity structures composed of identical
microresonators.

"Spin solid phases of spin 1 and spin 3/2 antiferromagnets on a cubic
  lattice","Karol Gregor, Olexei I. Motrunich","  We study spin S=1 and S=3/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a cubic lattice
focusing on spin solid states. Using Schwinger boson formulation for spins, we
start in a U(1) spin liquid phase proximate to Neel phase and explore possible
confining paramagnetic phases as we transition away from the spin liquid by the
process of monopole condensation. Electromagnetic duality is used to rewrite
the theory in terms of monopoles. For spin 1 we find several candidate phases
of which the most natural one is a phase with spins organized into parallel
Haldane chains. For spin 3/2 we find that the most natural phase has spins
organized into parallel ladders. As a by-product, we also write a Landau theory
of the ordering in two special classical frustrated XY models on the cubic
lattice, one of which is the fully frustrated XY model. In a particular limit
our approach maps to a dimer model with 2S dimers coming out of every site, and
we find the same spin solid phases in this regime as well.
"
Braided quantum field theories and their symmetries,"Yuya Sasai, Naoki Sasakura","  Braided quantum field theories proposed by Oeckl can provide a framework for
defining quantum field theories having Hopf algebra symmetries. In quantum
field theories, symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation
functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided
quantum field theories. We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf
algebra symmetries and braided quantum field theories, which are required for
the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the
Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is
the effective quantum field theory of three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled
with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is
noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane. We also comment on quantum field
theory on kappa-Minkowski spacetime.
"
Chromospheric Flares,Hugh S. Hudson,"  In this topical review I revisit the ""chromospheric flare."" This should
currently be an outdated concept, because modern data seem to rule out the
possiblity of a major flare happening independently in the chromosphere alone,
but the chromosphere still plays a major observational role in many ways. It is
the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the
visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the
coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the
propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the
chromosphere. The formation of chromospheric radiations during a flare presents
several difficult and interesting physical problems.

"Electronic structure of kinetic energy driven superconductors in the
  presence of bilayer splitting","Yu Lan, Jihong Qin and Shiping Feng","  Within the framework of the kinetic energy driven superconductivity, the
electronic structure of bilayer cuprate superconductors in the superconducting
state is studied. It is shown that the electron spectrum of bilayer cuprate
superconductors is split into the bonding and antibonding components by the
bilayer splitting, then the observed peak-dip-hump structure around the
$[\pi,0]$ point is mainly caused by this bilayer splitting, with the
superconducting peak being related to the antibonding component, and the hump
being formed by the bonding component. The spectral weight increases with
increasing the doping concentration. In analogy to the normal state case, both
electron antibonding peak and bonding hump have the weak dispersions around the
$[\pi,0]$ point.

"9.7 micrometer Silicate Absorption in a Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber at
  z=0.52","Varsha P. Kulkarni, Donald G. York, Giovanni Vladilo, Daniel E. Welty","  We report a detection of the 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption feature in a
damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) system at z_{abs} = 0.524 toward AO0235+164, using the
Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The feature
shows a broad shallow profile over about 8-12 micrometers in the absorber rest
frame and appears to be > 15 sigma significant in equivalent width. The feature
is fit reasonably well by the silicate absorption profiles for laboratory
amorphous olivine or diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds. To our knowledge,
this is the first indication of 9.7 micrometer silicate absorption in a DLA. We
discuss potential implications of this finding for the nature of the dust in
quasar absorbers. Although the feature is relatively shallow (tau_{9.7} =
0.08-0.09), it is about 2 times deeper than expected from extrapolation of the
tau_{9.7} vs. E(B-V) relation known for diffuse Galactic interstellar clouds.
Further studies of the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature in quasar absorbers will
open a new window on the dust in distant galaxies.

"Photometry of the Globular Cluster NGC 5466: Red Giants and Blue
  Stragglers","Nassissie Fekadu, Eric L. Sandquist, Michael Bolte","  We present wide-field BVI photometry for about 11,500 stars in the
low-metallicity cluster NGC 5466. We have detected the red giant branch bump
for the first time, although it is at least 0.2 mag fainter than expected
relative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence
turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the
Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina
models. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to
main-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss
theoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the
inclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb
interactions may be partly responsible.
  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent
and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,
consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue
straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or
RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at
large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that
the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density
structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually
low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of
this, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on the
frequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.

"Vortex Molecular Crystal and Vortex Plastic Crystal States in Honeycomb
  and Kagome Pinning Arrays",C. Reichhardt and C. J. Olson Reichhardt,"  Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinning
in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a
variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that
kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical
current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.

"Quark-Antiquark and Diquark Condensates in Vacuum in a 3D Two-Flavor
  Gross-Neveu Model",Bang-Rong Zhou (Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences),"  The effective potential analysis indicates that, in a 3D two-flavor
Gross-Neveu model in vacuum, depending on less or bigger than the critical
value 2/3 of $G_S/H_P$, where $G_S$ and $H_P$ are respectively the coupling
constants of scalar quark-antiquark channel and pseudoscalar diquark channel,
the system will have the ground state with pure diquark condensates or with
pure quark-antiquark condensates, but no the one with coexistence of the two
forms of condensates. The similarities and differences in the interplay between
the quark-antiquark and the diquark condensates in vacuum in the 2D, 3D and 4D
two-flavor four-fermion interaction models are summarized.

Spin accumulation from the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect,"Qin Liu, Tianxing Ma, Shou-Cheng Zhang","  Recently, it has been shown that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the
Dresselhaus type in $[110]$ quantum wells can be mathematically removed by a
non-Abelian gauge transformation. In the presence of an additional uniform
magnetic field, such a non-Abelian gauge flux leads to a spin accumulation at
the edges of the sample, where the relative sign of the spin accumulation
between the edges can be tuned by the sign of the Dresselhaus SOC constant. Our
prediction can be tested by Kerr measurements within the available experimental
sensitivities.

"On packet lengths and overhead for random linear coding over the erasure
  channel",Brooke Shrader and Anthony Ephremides,"  We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue
of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets
sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly
long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per
packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate
approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure
probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a
particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for
a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the
performance gains offered by random network coding.

"Terrestrial and Habitable Planet Formation in Binary and Multi-star
  Systems","Nader Haghighipour, Steinn Sigurdsson, Jack Lissauer, Sean Raymond","  One of the most surprising discoveries of extrasolar planets is the detection
of planets in moderately close binary star systems. The Jovian-type planets in
the two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefront
questions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of the
existence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. The
diverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonder
to what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied to
binaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of the
detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in
binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the
recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of
more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the
horizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and
habitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental
insights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic
impact on NASA science and missions.

P-adic arithmetic coding,"Anatoly Rodionov, Sergey Volkov","  A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequence
of input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number as
an output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adic
integer and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithm
is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding
algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression
technique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the
algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of
models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another
special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.
"
Compton X-ray and Gamma-ray Emission from Extended Radio Galaxies,C.C. Cheung,"  The extended lobes of radio galaxies are examined as sources of X-ray and
gamma-ray emission via inverse Compton scattering of 3K background photons. The
Compton spectra of two exemplary examples, Fornax A and Centaurus A, are
estimated using available radio measurements in the ~10's MHz - 10's GHz range.
For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra are
predicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable with
the GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will
make it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this
process operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that such
systems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is briefly
considered.

A matroid-friendly basis for the quasisymmetric functions,Kurt W. Luoto,"  A new Z-basis for the space of quasisymmetric functions (QSym, for short) is
presented. It is shown to have nonnegative structure constants, and several
interesting properties relative to the space of quasisymmetric functions
associated to matroids by the Hopf algebra morphism (F) of Billera, Jia, and
Reiner. In particular, for loopless matroids, this basis reflects the grading
by matroid rank, as well as by the size of the ground set. It is shown that the
morphism F is injective on the set of rank two matroids, and that
decomposability of the quasisymmetric function of a rank two matroid mirrors
the decomposability of its base polytope. An affirmative answer is given to the
Hilbert basis question raised by Billera, Jia, and Reiner.

Bremsstrahlung Radiation At a Vacuum Bubble Wall,"Jae-Weon Lee, Kyungsub Kim, Chul H. Lee, Ji-ho Jang","  When charged particles collide with a vacuum bubble, they can radiate strong
electromagnetic waves due to rapid deceleration. Owing to the energy loss of
the particles by this bremsstrahlung radiation, there is a non-negligible
damping pressure acting on the bubble wall even when thermal equilibrium is
maintained. In the non-relativistic region, this pressure is proportional to
the velocity of the wall and could have influenced the bubble dynamics in the
early universe.

"Universal Source Coding for Monotonic and Fast Decaying Monotonic
  Distributions",Gil I. Shamir,"  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic
distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of
size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

Moduli spaces of rational tropical curves,Grigory Mikhalkin,"  This note is devoted to the definition of moduli spaces of rational tropical

compactification of this space and tropical $\psi$-class divisors.

"Associated production of the charged Higgs boson and single top quark at
  the LHC","Yao-Bei Liu, Jie-Fen Shen","  The left-right twin Higgs(LRTH) model predicts the existence of the charged
Higgs $\phi^{\pm}$. In this paper, we study the production of the charged Higgs
boson $\phi^{-}$ with single top quark via the process $bg\to t\phi^{-}$ at the
$CERN$ Large Hadron Collider(LHC). The numerical results show that the
production cross section can reach the level of $10 pb$ in the reasonable
parameter space of the LRTH model. We expect that, as long as it is not too
heavy, the possible signatures of the heavy charged Higgs boson $\phi^{-}$
might be detected via the decay mode $\phi^{-}\to \bar{t}b$ at the LHC
experiments.

Difermion condensates in vacuum in 2-4D four-fermion interaction models,Bang-Rong Zhou (Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Sciences),"  Theoretical analysis of interplay between the condensates $<\bar{q}q>$ and
$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the
mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$
color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,
interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for
2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are
respectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$
and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only
pure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger
than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions
entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or
$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will
manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D
model, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,
besides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase
diagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real
constraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.

Oscillation bands of condensates on a ring: Beyond the mean field theory,Chengguang Bao,"  The Hamiltonian of a N-boson system confined on a ring with zero spin and
repulsive interaction is diagonalized. The excitation of a pair of
p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation
of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states
can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is
studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating
from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the
appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into
being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation
between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.
"
Kadowaki-Woods Ratio of Strongly Coupled Fermi Liquids,Takuya Okabe,"  On the basis of the Fermi liquid theory, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio
$A/\gamma^2$ is evaluated by using a first principle band calculation for
typical itinerant $d$ and $f$ electron systems. It is found as observed that
the ratio for the $d$ electron systems is significantly smaller than the normal
$f$ systems, even without considering their relatively weak correlation. The
difference in the ratio value comes from different characters of the Fermi
surfaces. By comparing Pd and USn$_3$ as typical cases, we discuss the
importance of the Fermi surface dependence of the quasiparticle transport
relaxation.

Structure of Strange Dwarfs with Color Superconducting Core,Masayuki Matsuzaki and Etsuchika Kobayashi (Fukuoka Univ. of Educ.),"  We study effects of two-flavor color superconductivity on the structure of

ordinary white dwarfs but stabilized by the strange quark matter core. We find
that unpaired quark matter is a good approximation to the core of strange
dwarfs.

Information entropic superconducting microcooler,"A. O. Niskanen, Y. Nakamura, J. P. Pekola","  We consider a design for a cyclic microrefrigerator using a superconducting
flux qubit. Adiabatic modulation of the flux combined with thermalization can
be used to transfer energy from a lower temperature normal metal thin film
resistor to another one at higher temperature. The frequency selectivity of
photonic heat conduction is achieved by including the hot resistor as part of a
high frequency LC resonator and the cold one as part of a low-frequency
oscillator while keeping both circuits in the underdamped regime. We discuss
the performance of the device in an experimentally realistic setting. This
device illustrates the complementarity of information and thermodynamic entropy
as the erasure of the quantum bit directly relates to the cooling of the
resistor.

PI degree parity in q-skew polynomial rings,Heidi Haynal,"  For k a field of arbitrary characteristic, and R a k-algebra, we show that
the PI degree of an iterated skew polynomial ring
R[x_1;\tau_1,\delta_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n,\delta_n] agrees with the PI degree of
R[x_1;\tau_1]...b[x_n;\tau_n] when each (\tau_i,\delta_i) satisfies a q_i-skew
relation for q_i \in k^{\times} and extends to a higher q_i-skew
\tau_i-derivation. We confirm the quantum Gel'fand-Kirillov conjecture for
various quantized coordinate rings, and calculate their PI degrees. We extend
these results to completely prime factor algebras.

Semi-spheroidal Quantum Harmonic Oscillator,"D. N. Poenaru, R. A. Gherghescu, A. V. Solov'yov, W. Greiner","  A new single-particle shell model is derived by solving the Schr\""odinger

Growing Perfect Decagonal Quasicrystals by Local Rules,Hyeong-Chai Jeong,"  A local growth algorithm for a decagonal quasicrystal is presented. We show
that a perfect Penrose tiling (PPT) layer can be grown on a decapod tiling
layer by a three dimensional (3D) local rule growth. Once a PPT layer begins to
form on the upper layer, successive 2D PPT layers can be added on top resulting
in a perfect decagonal quasicrystalline structure in bulk with a point defect
only on the bottom surface layer. Our growth rule shows that an ideal
quasicrystal structure can be constructed by a local growth algorithm in 3D,
contrary to the necessity of non-local information for a 2D PPT growth.

"LRS Bianchi Type-V Viscous Fluid Universe With a Time Dependent
  Cosmological Term $\Lambda$","Anirudh Pradhan, J. P. Shahi and C. V. Singh","  An LRS Bianchi type-V cosmological models representing a viscous fluid

To get a determinate solution, the viscosity coefficient of bulk viscous fluid
is assumed to be a power function of mass density. It turns out that the
cosmological term $\Lambda(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, which is
consistent with recent observations of type Ia supernovae. Various physical and
kinematic features of these models have also been explored.

"Density matrix elements and entanglement entropy for the spin-1/2 XXZ
  chain at $\Delta$=1/2","Jun Sato, Masahiro Shiroishi","  We have analytically obtained all the density matrix elements up to six
lattice sites for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain at $\Delta=1/2$. We use the
multiple integral formula of the correlation function for the massless XXZ
chain derived by Jimbo and Miwa. As for the spin-spin correlation functions, we
have newly obtained the fourth- and fifth-neighbour transverse correlation
functions. We have calculated all the eigenvalues of the density matrix and
analyze the eigenvalue-distribution. Using these results the exact values of
the entanglement entropy for the reduced density matrix up six lattice sites
have been obtained. We observe that our exact results agree quite well with the
asymptotic formula predicted by the conformal field theory.

  Guang-Can Guo","  Influence of hole shape on extraordinary optical transmission was
investigated using hole arrays consisting of rectangular holes with different
aspect ratio. It was found that the transmission could be tuned continuously by
rotating the hole array. Further more, a phase was generated in this process,
and linear polarization states could be changed to elliptical polarization
states. This phase was correlated with the aspect ratio of the holes. An
intuitional model was presented to explain these results.

Three dimensional cooling and trapping with a narrow line,"Thierry Chaneliere (LAC), Ling Xiang He, Robin Kaiser (INLN), David

cooling to reach the photon recoil limit with Doppler cooling in a
magneto-optical traps (MOT). In this paper we present a systematic study of the

simple model allows us to discuss the actual limitation of our apparatus. We
also study in detail the final MOT regime emphasizing the role of gravity on
the position, size and temperature along the vertical and horizontal

cooling and trapping occur in the presence of a high bias magnetic field.

Extrasolar scale change in Newton's Law from 5D `plain' R^2-gravity,I.L. Zhogin,"  Galactic rotation curves and lack of direct observations of Dark Matter may
indicate that General Relativity is not valid (on galactic scale) and should be
replaced with another theory. There is the only variant of Absolute Parallelism
which solutions are free of arising singularities, if D=5 (there is no room for
changes). This variant does not have a Lagrangian, nor match GR: an equation of
`plain' R^2-gravity (ie without R-term) is in sight instead. Arranging an
expanding O_4-symmetrical solution as the basis of 5D cosmological model, and
probing a universal_function of mass distribution (along very-very long the
extra dimension) to place into bi-Laplace equation (R^2 gravity), one can
derive the Law of Gravitation: 1/r^2 transforms to 1/r with distance (not with
acceleration).

and Wiener energy in the abstract linear potential analytic setting pioneered
by Choquet, Fuglede and Ohtsuka. It turns out that, whenever the potential
theoretic kernel has the maximum principle, then all these quantities are equal
for all compact sets. For continuous kernels even the converse statement is
true: if the Chebyshev constant of any compact set coincides with its
transfinite diameter, the kernel must satisfy the maximum principle. An
abundance of examples is provided to show the sharpness of the results.

"Availability assessment of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems based on Syslogd
  and wtmpx logfiles : a case study","Cristina Simache (LAAS), Mohamed Kaaniche (LAAS)","  This paper presents a measurement-based availability assessment study using
field data collected during a 4-year period from 373 SunOS/Solaris Unix
workstations and servers interconnected through a local area network. We focus
on the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on the
identification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds to
syslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normal
activity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence of
failures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such event
logs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paper
to address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of data
obtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operating
system. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogd
log files provides more complete information on the state of the target systems
that is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.

The Low CO Content of the Extremely Metal Poor Galaxy I Zw 18,"Adam Leroy, John Cannon, Fabian Walter, Alberto Bolatto, Axel Weiss","  We present sensitive molecular line observations of the metal-poor blue
compact dwarf I Zw 18 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer.
These data constrain the CO J=1-0 luminosity within our 300 pc (FWHM) beam to
be L_CO < 1 \times 10^5 K km s^-1 pc^2 (I_CO < 1 K km s^-1), an order of
magnitude lower than previous limits. Although I Zw 18 is starbursting, it has
a CO luminosity similar to or less than nearby low-mass irregulars (e.g. NGC
1569, the SMC, and NGC 6822). There is less CO in I Zw 18 relative to its
B-band luminosity, HI mass, or star formation rate than in spiral or dwarf
starburst galaxies (including the nearby dwarf starburst IC 10). Comparing the
star formation rate to our CO upper limit reveals that unless molecular gas
forms stars much more efficiently in I Zw 18 than in our own galaxy, it must
have a very low CO-to-H_2 ratio, \sim 10^-2 times the Galactic value. We detect
3mm continuum emission, presumably due to thermal dust and free-free emission,
towards the radio peak.

A binary model for the UV-upturn of elliptical galaxies (MNRAS version),"Z. Han, Ph. Podsiadlowski, A.E. Lynas-Gray","  The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of
elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that
this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

Redshifts of the Long Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Z. Bagoly, I. Csabai, A. Meszaros, P. Meszaros, I. Horvath, L.G.
  Balazs, R. Vavrek","  The low energy spectra of some gamma-ray bursts' show excess components
beside the power-law dependence. The consequences of such a feature allows to
estimate the gamma photometric redshift of the long gamma-ray bursts in the
BATSE Catalog. There is good correlation between the measured optical and the
estimated gamma photometric redshifts. The estimated redshift values for the
long bright gamma-ray bursts are up to z=4, while for the the faint long bursts
- which should be up to z=20 - the redshifts cannot be determined unambiguously
with this method. The redshift distribution of all the gamma-ray bursts with
known optical redshift agrees quite well with the BATSE based gamma photometric
redshift distribution.

An architecture-based dependability modeling framework using AADL,"Ana-Elena Rugina (LAAS), Karama Kanoun (LAAS), Mohamed Kaaniche (LAAS)","  For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an

bidegree $(1,1)$ which is nonnegative and big. We study the classes ${\mathcal
E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$ of $\om$-plurisubharmonic functions of finite weighted
Monge-Amp\`ere energy. When the weight $\chi$ has fast growth at infinity, the
corresponding functions are close to be bounded.
  We show that if a positive Radon measure is suitably dominated by the
Monge-Amp\`ere capacity, then it belongs to the range of the Monge-Amp\`ere
operator on some class ${\mathcal E}_{\chi}(X,\om)$. This is done by
establishing a priori estimates on the capacity of sublevel sets of the
solutions.

"Density oscillation in highly flattened quantum elliptic rings and
  tunable strong dipole radiation","Shuping Situ, Yanzhang He and Chengguang Bao","  A narrow elliptic ring containing an electron threaded by a magnetic field B
is studied. When the ring is highly flattened, the increase of B would lead to
a big energy gap between the ground and excited states, and therefore lead to a
strong emission of dipole photons. The photon frequency can be tuned in a wide
range by changing B and/or the shape of the ellipse. The particle density is
found to oscillate from a pattern of distribution to another pattern back and
forth against $B$. This is a new kind of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation originating
from symmetry breaking and is different from the usual oscillation of
persistent current.

"Effect of electron-electron interaction on the phonon-mediated spin
  relaxation in quantum dots","Juan I. Climente, Andrea Bertoni, Guido Goldoni, Massimo Rontani,
  Elisa Molinari","  We estimate the spin relaxation rate due to spin-orbit coupling and acoustic
phonon scattering in weakly-confined quantum dots with up to five interacting
electrons. The Full Configuration Interaction approach is used to account for
the inter-electron repulsion, and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings
are exactly diagonalized. We show that electron-electron interaction strongly
affects spin-orbit admixture in the sample. Consequently, relaxation rates
strongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the
mechanisms which may lead to improved spin stability in few electron (>2)
quantum dots as compared to the usual one and two electron devices. Finally, we
discuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject
to external magnetic fields. Our simulations are in good agreement with the
experimental findings, and support the interpretation of the observed spin
relaxation as being due to spin-orbit coupling assisted by acoustic phonon
emission.

  Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences)","  Short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,
known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

Spectral perturbation bounds for selfadjoint operators,K. Veselic,"  We give general spectral and eigenvalue perturbation bounds for a selfadjoint

Predicting the frequencies of diverse exo-planetary systems,"J.S. Greaves, D.A. Fischer, M.C. Wyatt, C.A. Beichman and G. Bryden","  Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts
more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of
solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star
retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be
used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming
massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By
extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like
planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass
exo-planets.

"Higher ramification and varieties of secant divisors on the generic
  curve",Gavril Farkas,"  For a smooth projective curve, the cycles of e-secant k-planes are among the
most studied objects in classical enumerative geometry and there are well-known
formulas due to Castelnuovo, Cayley and MacDonald concerning them. Despite
various attempts, surprisingly little is known about the enumerative validity
of such formulas. The aim of this paper is to completely clarify this problem
in the case of the generic curve C of given genus. Using degeneration
techniques and a few facts about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of
stable pointed curves we determine precisely under which conditions the cycle
of e-secant k-planes in non-empty and we compute its dimension. We also
precisely determine the dimension of the variety of linear series on C carrying
e-secant k-planes. In a different direction, in the last part of the paper we
study the distribution of ramification points of the powers of a line bundle on
C having prescribed ramification at a given point.

The bimodality of type Ia Supernovae,"F. Mannucci, N. Panagia, M. Della Valle","  We comment on the presence of a bimodality in the distribution of delay time
between the formation of the progenitors and their explosion as type Ia SNe.
Two ""flavors"" of such bimodality are present in the literature: a ""weak""
bimodality, in which type Ia SNe must explode from both young and old
progenitors, and a ""strong"" bimodality, in which about half of the systems
explode within 10^8 years from formation. The ""weak"" bimodality is
observationally based on the dependence of the rates with the host galaxy SFR,
while the ""strong"" one on the different rates in radio-loud and radio-quiet
early-type galaxies. We review the evidence for these bimodalities. Finally, we
estimate the fraction of SNe which are missed by optical and near-IR searches
because of dust extinction in massive starbursts.

Structural relaxation around substitutional Cr3+ in MgAl2O4,"Am\'elie Juhin (IMPMC), Georges Calas (IMPMC), Delphine Cabaret
  (IMPMC), Laurence Galoisy (IMPMC), Jean-Louis Hazemann","  The structural environment of substitutional Cr3+ ion in MgAl2O4 spinel has
been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies.
First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES
spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O
distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first
neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These
observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4
solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of
the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr
for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond
buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred
octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles
between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three
four-fold axes of the cubic structure.

"A Hierarchical Approach for Dependability Analysis of a Commercial
  Cache-Based RAID Storage Architecture","Mohamed Kaaniche (LAAS), Luigi Romano (UIUC), Zbigniew Kalbarczyk
  (UIUC), Ravishankar Iyer (UIUC), Rick Karcich (STORAGETEK)","  We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis
and evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage
system. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of
overlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels
have been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and
error detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors
oc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the
hierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The
models have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for
system-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject
faults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and
recovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault
models are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk
failures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the
disks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given
submodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the
lower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and
analyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate
(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms
implemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the
accumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.

Stochastic action principle and maximum entropy,"Q. A. Wang (ISMANS), F. Tsobnang (ISMANS), S. Bangoup (ISMANS), F.
  Dzangue (ISMANS), A. Jeatsa (ISMANS), A. Le M\'ehaut\'e (ISMANS)","  A stochastic action principle for stochastic dynamics is revisited. We
present first numerical diffusion experiments showing that the diffusion path
probability depend exponentially on average Lagrangian action. This result is
then used to derive an uncertainty measure defined in a way mimicking the heat
or entropy in the first law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the path
uncertainty (or path entropy) can be measured by the Shannon information and
that the maximum entropy principle and the least action principle of classical
mechanics can be unified into a concise form. It is argued that this action
principle, hence the maximum entropy principle, is simply a consequence of the
mechanical equilibrium condition extended to the case of stochastic dynamics.

Constraining the Dark Energy Equation of State with Cosmic Voids,"Jounghun Lee, Daeseong Park (Seoul Nat'l Univ.)","  Our universe is observed to be accelerating due to the dominant dark energy
with negative pressure. The dark energy equation of state (w) holds a key to
understanding the ultimate fate of the universe. The cosmic voids behave like
bubbles in the universe so that their shapes must be quite sensitive to the
background cosmology. Assuming a flat universe and using the priors on the
matter density parameter (Omega_m) and the dimensionless Hubble parameter (h),
we demonstrate analytically that the ellipticity evolution of cosmic voids may
be a sensitive probe of the dark energy equation of state. We also discuss the
parameter degeneracy between w and Omega_m.

A Dark Energy model combining DGP gravity and Chaplygin gas,Matts Roos,"  The expansion of the Universe is accelerating, as testified by observations
of supernovae of type Ia as a function of redshift. Explanations are of two
types: modifications of Einstein gravity or new forms of energy, coined dark
energy.The accelerated expansion is explained here by a combination of
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model gravity and Chaplygin gas dark energy. Both
models are characterized by a length scale L which may be the same. The
continuity equation for the combined model is derived in flat geometry, and
solved by numerical methods. The solution is shown to have the expected
properties: at very small scales (a<<L) the energy density behaves as
pressureless dust, at very large scales (a>>L) as a cosmological constant. The
modifications to the DGP model and the Chaplygin gas model occur for values of
a L. The results show an increase in the present dark energy density relative
to the plain DGP model.

Gauge-Higgs Unification and LHC/ILC,Yutaka Hosotani,"  In the gauge-Higgs unification scenario the 4D Higgs field is identified with
the zero mode of the extra-dimensional component of gauge potentials. The mass
of the Higgs particle in the unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped
spacetime is predicted to be in the range 100 GeV - 300 GeV. The WWZ gauge
couplings remains almost universal as in the standard model, but substantial
deviation results for the Higgs couplings. The WWH and ZZH couplings are
suppressed by a factor \cos \theta_H from the values in the standard model,
where \theta_H is the Yang-Mills AB phase along the fifth dimension. These can
be tested at LHC and ILC.

Uniform measures and countably additive measures,Jan Pachl,"  Uniform measures are defined as the functionals on the space of bounded
uniformly continuous functions that are continuous on bounded uniformly
equicontinuous sets. If every cardinal has measure zero then every countably
additive measure is a uniform measure. The functionals sequentially continuous
on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets are exactly uniform measures on the
separable modification of the underlying uniform space.
"
Lower bounds for the conductivities of correlated quantum systems,Peter Jung and Achim Rosch,"  We show how one can obtain a lower bound for the electrical, spin or heat
conductivity of correlated quantum systems described by Hamiltonians of the
form H = H0 + g H1. Here H0 is an interacting Hamiltonian characterized by
conservation laws which lead to an infinite conductivity for g=0. The small
perturbation g H1, however, renders the conductivity finite at finite
temperatures. For example, H0 could be a continuum field theory, where momentum
is conserved, or an integrable one-dimensional model while H1 might describe
the effects of weak disorder. In the limit g to 0, we derive lower bounds for
the relevant conductivities and show how they can be improved systematically
using the memory matrix formalism. Furthermore, we discuss various applications
and investigate under what conditions our lower bound may become exact.

Non-extensive thermodynamics of 1D systems with long-range interaction,"S. S. Apostolov, Z. A. Mayzelis, O. V. Usatenko, V. A. Yampol'skii","  A new approach to non-extensive thermodynamical systems with non-additive
energy and entropy is proposed. The main idea of the paper is based on the
statistical matching of the thermodynamical systems with the additive
multi-step Markov chains. This general approach is applied to the Ising spin
chain with long-range interaction between its elements. The asymptotical
expressions for the energy and entropy of the system are derived for the
limiting case of weak interaction. These thermodynamical quantities are found
to be non-proportional to the length of the system (number of its particle).

  BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$","S. Kramer (LCMI), R. Stern, M. Horvatic (LCMI), C. Berthier (LCMI), T.
  Kimura (LANL), I.R. Fisher","  We present a $^{63,65}$Cu and $^{29}$Si NMR study of the quasi-2D coupled
spin 1/2 dimer compound BaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ in the magnetic field range 13-26 T and
at temperatures as low as 50 mK. NMR data in the gapped phase reveal that below
90 K different intra-dimer exchange couplings and different gaps
($\Delta_{\rm{B}}/\Delta_{\rm{A}}$ = 1.16) exist in every second plane along
the c-axis, in addition to a planar incommensurate (IC) modulation. $^{29}$Si
spectra in the field induced magnetic ordered phase reveal that close to the
quantum critical point at $H_{\rm{c1}}$ = 23.35 T the average boson density
$\bar{n}$ of the Bose-Einstein condensate is strongly modulated along the
c-axis with a density ratio for every second plane
$\bar{n}_{\rm{A}}/\bar{n}_{\rm{B}} \simeq 5$. An IC modulation of the local
density is also present in each plane. This adds new constraints for the
understanding of the 2D value $\phi$ = 1 of the critical exponent describing
the phase boundary.

"Bibliometric statistical properties of the 100 largest European
  universities: prevalent scaling rules in the science system",Anthony F. J. van Raan,"  For the 100 largest European universities we studied the statistical
properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field
citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative
advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance
universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations
with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and
average journal impact.

On the Origin of Asymmetries in Bilateral Supernova Remnants,"S. Orlando, F. Bocchino, F. Reale, G. Peres, O. Petruk","  AIMS: We investigate whether the morphology of bilateral supernova remnants
(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks,"Xingang Wang, Meng Zhan, Ghuguang Guan, and Choy Heng Lai","  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are
investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.

experimental demonstration is provided in the context of polarization and

The topological phase is evidenced through interferometric measurements and a
quantitative relationship between the concurrence and the fringes visibility is
derived. Both the quantum and the classical regimes were investigated.

  University, (2) University of Montreal, (3) University of Edinburgh Royal
  Observatory)","  We present spectra for 33 previously unclassified white dwarf systems
brighter than V = 17 primarily in the southern hemisphere. Of these new
systems, 26 are DA, 4 are DC, 2 are DZ, and 1 is DQ. We suspect three of these
systems are unresolved double degenerates. We obtained VRI photometry for these
33 objects as well as for 23 known white dwarf systems without trigonometric
parallaxes, also primarily in the southern hemisphere. For the 56 objects, we
converted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy
distribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure
hydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of
effective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are
estimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons
of 25 pc, constituting a potential 18% increase in the nearby white dwarf
sample. Trigonometric parallax determinations are underway via CTIOPI for these
20 systems.
  One of the DCs is cool so that it displays absorption in the near infrared.
Using the distance determined via trigonometric parallax, we are able to
constrain the model-dependent physical parameters and find that this object is
most likely a mixed H/He atmosphere white dwarf similar to other cool white
dwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared
due to collision-induced absorptions by molecular hydrogen.

Model C critical dynamics of random anisotropy magnets,"M. Dudka, R. Folk, Yu. Holovatch, G. Moser","  We study the relaxational critical dynamics of the three-dimensional random
anisotropy magnets with the non-conserved n-component order parameter coupled
to a conserved scalar density. In the random anisotropy magnets the structural
disorder is present in a form of local quenched anisotropy axes of random
orientation. When the anisotropy axes are randomly distributed along the edges
of the n-dimensional hypercube, asymptotical dynamical critical properties
coincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder
gives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We
investigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group
analysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain
quantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of
the order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios
for the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.

A unified approach to the theory of separately holomorphic mappings,Viet-Anh Nguyen,"  We extend the theory of separately holomorphic mappings between complex

dimension 1. It also relies on our new technique of conformal mappings and a
generalization of Siciak's relative extremal function.
  Our approach illustrates the unified character: ``From local informations to
global extensions"". Moreover, it avoids systematically the use of the classical
method of doubly orthogonal bases of Bergman type.

Voltage-Current curves for small Josephson junction arrays,Benoit Doucot and Lev B. Ioffe,"  We compute the current voltage characteristic of a chain of identical
Josephson circuits characterized by a large ratio of Josephson to charging

qubits. We show that in the limit of small coupling to the environment it
exhibits a non-monotonous behavior with a maximum voltage followed by a
parametrically large region where $V\propto 1/I$. We argue that its
experimental measurement provides a direct probe of the amplitude of the
quantum transitions in constituting Josephson circuits and thus allows their
full characterization.

"The density of critical percolation clusters touching the boundaries of

constrained to touch one or both boundaries, in infinite strips, half-infinite
strips, and squares, as well as several related quantities for the infinite
strip. Our theoretical results follow from conformal field theory, and are
compared with high-precision numerical simulation. For example, we show that
the density of clusters touching both boundaries of an infinite strip of unit
width (i.e. crossing clusters) is proportional to $(\sin \pi
y)^{-5/48}\{[\cos(\pi y/2)]^{1/3} +[\sin (\pi y/2)]^{1/3}-1\}$.
  We also determine numerically contours for the density of clusters crossing
squares and long rectangles with open boundaries on the sides, and compare with
theory for the density along an edge.

"Effective band-structure in the insulating phase versus strong dynamical

field calculations, we analyze real-frequency self-energies, momentum-resolved
spectral functions, and one-particle excitations of the metallic and insulating
phases of VO2. While for the former dynamical correlations and lifetime effects
prevent a description in terms of quasi-particles, the excitations of the
latter allow for an effective band-structure. We construct an
orbital-dependent, but static one-particle potential that reproduces the full
many-body spectrum. Yet, the ground state is well beyond a static one-particle
description. The emerging picture gives a non-trivial answer to the decade-old
question of the nature of the insulator, which we characterize as a ``many-body
Peierls'' state.

"New possible properties of atomic nuclei investigated by non linear
  methods: Fractal and recurrence quantification analysis","Elio Conte, Andrei Yu. Khrennikov, Joseph P. Zbilut","  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to
investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

"The Use of Weighting in Periodicity Searches in All-Sky Monitor Data:
  Applications to the GLAST LAT","Robin Corbet, Richard Dubois","  The light curves produced by all-sky monitors, such as the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer All-Sky Monitor and the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), generally
have non-uniform error bars. In searching for periodic modulation in this type
of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of
data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that
for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the
sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a
modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives
improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits
of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT
observations of gamma-ray binaries.

recombination (DR) of Mg-like Fe XV forming Al-like Fe XIV via N=3 -> N' = 3
core excitations in the electron-ion collision energy range 0-45 eV. All
measurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the Max
Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have also
carried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the
AUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor
agreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and
strengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for
resonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance
strengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than
our estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%
(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between
the calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly
to the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in
the experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our
AUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR rate
coefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient is
estimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) for
k_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predicted
to form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found between
our experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously published
theoretical results. Our new MCBP plasma rate coefficient is 19-28% smaller
than our experimental results over this temperature range.

"Metropolis algorithm and equienergy sampling for two mean field spin
  systems","Bassetti Federico, Leisen Fabrizio","  In this paper we study the Metropolis algorithm in connection with two
mean--field spin systems, the so called mean--field Ising model and the
Blume--Emery--Griffiths model. In both this examples the naive choice of
proposal chain gives rise, for some parameters, to a slowly mixing Metropolis
chain, that is a chain whose spectral gap decreases exponentially fast (in the
dimension $N$ of the problem). Here we show how a slight variant in the
proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost
similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with
a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap
which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the
energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level
of the starting state.

Extragalactic Radio Sources and the WMAP Cold Spot,"Lawrence Rudnick, Shea Brown, and Liliya R. Williams","  We detect a dip of 20-45% in the surface brightness and number counts of NVSS
sources smoothed to a few degrees at the location of the WMAP cold spot. The
dip has structure on scales of approximately 1-10 degrees. Together with
independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in
extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are
physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly
nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from
structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need
for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain
the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen
statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single
region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires
a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This
is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds
to the anomalies seen in the CMB.

$\phi(a_1 ... a_n) = \phi(a_1)... \phi(a_n)$ for all elements $a_1, >..., a_n
\in A.$ Every homomorphism is an n-homomorphism, for all n >= 2, but the
converse is false, in general. Hejazian et al. [7] ask: Is every *-preserving
n-homomorphism between C*-algebras continuous? We answer their question in the
affirmative, but the even and odd n arguments are surprisingly disjoint. We
then use these results to prove stronger ones: If n >2 is even, then $\phi$ is
just an ordinary *-homomorphism. If n >= 3 is odd, then $\phi$ is a difference
of two orthogonal *-homomorphisms. Thus, there are no nontrivial *-linear
n-homomorphisms between C*-algebras.

Smooth and Starburst Tidal Tails in the GEMS and GOODS Fields,"Debra Meloy Elmegreen (1), Bruce G. Elmegreen (2), Thomas Ferguson
  (1), Brendan Mullan (1,3) ((1) Vassar College, (2) IBM T.J. Watson Research
  Center, (3) Colgate University)","  GEMS and GOODS fields were examined to z~1.4 for galaxy interactions and
mergers. The basic morphologies are familiar: antennae with long tidal tails,
tidal dwarfs, and merged cores; M51-type galaxies with disk spirals and tidal
arm companions; early-type galaxies with diffuse plumes; equal-mass
grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

Nuclear Spin Effects in Optical Lattice Clocks,"Martin M. Boyd, Tanya Zelevinsky, Andrew D. Ludlow, Sebastian Blatt,
  Thomas Zanon-Willette, Seth M. Foreman and Jun Ye","  We present a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the effect of
nuclear spin on the performance of optical lattice clocks. With a state-mixing
theory including spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions, we describe the origin
of the $^1S_0$-$^3P_0$ clock transition and the differential g-factor between
the two clock states for alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, using $^{87}$Sr as an
example. Clock frequency shifts due to magnetic and optical fields are
discussed with an emphasis on those relating to nuclear structure. An
experimental determination of the differential g-factor in $^{87}$Sr is
performed and is in good agreement with theory. The magnitude of the tensor
light shift on the clock states is also explored experimentally. State specific
measurements with controlled nuclear spin polarization are discussed as a
method to reduce the nuclear spin-related systematic effects to below
10$^{-17}$ in lattice clocks.

Domain wall switching: optimizing the energy landscape,"Zhihong Lu, P. B. Visscher, and W. H. Butler","  It has recently been suggested that exchange spring media offer a way to
increase media density without causing thermal instability
(superparamagnetism), by using a hard and a soft layer coupled by exchange.
Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of
the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching
field, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2
for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches
have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this
formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can
be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess
et al comes very close to this limit.

Electromagnetic wormholes via handlebody constructions,"Allan Greenleaf, Yaroslav Kurylev, Matti Lassas and Gunther Uhlmann","  Cloaking devices are prescriptions of electrostatic, optical or
electromagnetic parameter fields (conductivity $\sigma(x)$, index of refraction
$n(x)$, or electric permittivity $\epsilon(x)$ and magnetic permeability
$\mu(x)$) which are piecewise smooth on $\mathbb R^3$ and singular on a
hypersurface $\Sigma$, and such that objects in the region enclosed by $\Sigma$
are not detectable to external observation by waves. Here, we give related
constructions of invisible tunnels, which allow electromagnetic waves to pass
between possibly distant points, but with only the ends of the tunnels visible
to electromagnetic imaging. Effectively, these change the topology of space
with respect to solutions of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to attaching a
handlebody to $\mathbb R^3$. The resulting devices thus function as
electromagnetic wormholes.

  Catalyst Support","S. Noda, K. Hasegawa, H. Sugime, K. Kakehi, Z. Zhang, S. Maruyama, Y.
  Yamaguchi","  A parametric study of so-called ""super growth"" of single-walled carbon
nanotubes(SWNTs) was done by using combinatorial libraries of iron/aluminum
oxide catalysts. Millimeter-thick forests of nanotubes grew within 10 min, and
those grown by using catalysts with a thin Fe layer (about 0.5 nm) were SWNTs.
Although nanotube forests grew under a wide range of reaction conditions such
as gas composition and temperature, the window for SWNT was narrow. Fe
catalysts rapidly grew nanotubes only when supported on aluminum oxide.
Aluminum oxide, which is a well-known catalyst in hydrocarbon reforming, plays
an essential role in enhancing the nanotube growth rates.

  Curto, Christophe Lovis, Claire Moutou, Francesco Pepe, Didier Queloz, Nuno
  C. Santos and Stephane Udry","  The HARPS high-resolution high-accuracy spectrograph is offered to the
astronomical community since the second half of 2003. Since then, we have been
using this instrument for monitoring radial velocities of a large sample of
Solar-type stars (~1400 stars) in order to search for their possible low-mass
companions. Amongst the goals of our survey, one is to significantly increase
the number of detected extra-solar planets in a volume-limited sample to
improve our knowledge of their orbital elements distributions and thus obtain
better constraints for planet-formation models.
  In this paper, we present the HARPS radial-velocity data and orbital
solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The
radial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1
M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital
fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a
long-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric
orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.
The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal
temporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We
find clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile
variations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.
"
Algebraic geometry of Gaussian Bayesian networks,Seth Sullivant,"  Conditional independence models in the Gaussian case are algebraic varieties
in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties
in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the
recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the
case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of
the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by
graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with
respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.
This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.
Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical
constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the
Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

"Interactions, superconducting $T_c$, and fluctuation magnetization for
  two coupled dots in the crossover between the Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary
  ensembles","Oleksandr Zelyak, Ganpathy Murthy, Igor Rozhkov","  We study a system of two quantum dots connected by a hopping bridge. Both the
dots and connecting region are assumed to be in universal crossover regimes
between Gaussian Orthogonal and Unitary ensembles. Using a diagrammatic
approach appropriate for energy separations much larger than the level spacing
we obtain the ensemble-averaged one- and two-particle Green's functions. It
turns out that the diffuson and cooperon parts of the two-particle Green's
function can be described by separate scaling functions. We then use this
information to investigate a model interacting system in which one dot has an
attractive s-wave reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer interaction, while the
other is noninteracting but subject to an orbital magnetic field. We find that
the critical temperature is {\it nonmonotonic} in the flux through the second
dot in a certain regime of interdot coupling. Likewise, the fluctuation
magnetization above the critical temperature is also nonmonotonic in this
regime, can be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and can be deduced from the
cooperon scaling function.

semianalytical treatment of the problem. The model is applied to decays of the
first excited $3/2^{-}$ state of $^{17}$Ne and the $3/2^{-}$ ground state of
$^{45}$Fe. The convergence of three-body hyperspherical model calculations to
the exact result for widths and energy distributions are studied. The

uncertainties of the derived values are discussed in detail. Correlations for
the decay of $^{17}$Ne $3/2^-$ state are also studied.

Z^0 \to 2\gamma and the Twisted Coproduct of the Poincar\'{e} Group,"A. P. Balachandran, S. G. Jo","  Yang's theorem forbids the process $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ in any Poincar\'{e}
invariant theory if photons are bosons and their two-particle states transform
under the Poincar\'{e} group in the standard way (under the standard coproduct
of the Poincar\'{e} group). This is an important result as it does not depend
on the assumptions of quantum field theory. Recent work on noncommutative
geometry requires deforming the above coproduct by the Drinfel'd twist. We
prove that $Z^0 \to 2\gamma$ is forbidden for the twisted coproduct as well.
This result is also independent of the assumptions of quantum field theory. As
an illustration of the use of our general formulae, we further show that $Z^0
\to \nu + \nu$ is forbidden for the standard or twisted coproduct of the
Poincar\'{e} group if the neutrino is massless, even if lepton number is not
conserved. This is a special case of our general result that a massive particle
of spin $j$ cannot decay into two identical massless particles of the same
helicity if $j$ is odd, regardless of the coproduct used.

"Lower order terms in the 1-level density for families of holomorphic
  cuspidal newforms",Steven J. Miller,"  The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the
conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

Spinor Dynamics in an Antiferromagnetic Spin-1 Condensate,"A.T. Black, E. Gomez, L.D. Turner, S. Jung, P.D. Lett","  We observe coherent spin oscillations in an antiferromagnetic spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium. The variation of the spin oscillations with
magnetic field shows a clear signature of nonlinearity, in agreement with
theory, which also predicts anharmonic oscillations near a critical magnetic
field. Measurements of the magnetic phase diagram agree with predictions made
in the approximation of a single spatial mode. The oscillation period yields
the best measurement to date of the sodium spin-dependent interaction
coefficient, determining that the difference between the sodium spin-dependent
s-wave scattering lengths $a_{f=2}-a_{f=0}$ is $2.47\pm0.27$ Bohr radii.

A Contraction Theory Approach to Stochastic Incremental Stability,"Q.-C. Pham, N. Tabareau, J.-J. Slotine","  We investigate the incremental stability properties of It\^o stochastic

any two trajectories of a stochastically contracting system. This bound can be
expressed as a function of the noise intensity and the contraction rate of the
noise-free system. We illustrate these results in the contexts of stochastic
nonlinear observers design and stochastic synchronization.
"
A Symplectic Test of the L-Functions Ratios Conjecture,Steven J. Miller,"  Recently Conrey, Farmer and Zirnbauer conjectured formulas for the averages
over a family of ratios of products of shifted L-functions. Their L-functions
Ratios Conjecture predicts both the main and lower order terms for many
problems, ranging from n-level correlations and densities to mollifiers and
moments to vanishing at the central point. There are now many results showing
agreement between the main terms of number theory and random matrix theory;
however, there are very few families where the lower order terms are known.
These terms often depend on subtle arithmetic properties of the family, and
provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios
Conjecture provides a powerful and tractable way to predict these terms. We
test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic
family of quadratic Dirichlet characters arising from even fundamental
discriminants d \le X. For test functions supported in (-1/3, 1/3) we calculate
all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect
agreement with the conjecture (for test functions supported in (-1, 1) we show
agreement up to errors of size O(X^{-epsilon}) for any epsilon). Thus for this
family and suitably restricted test functions, we completely verify the Ratios
Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density.

Cosmology from String Theory,"Luis Anchordoqui, Haim Goldberg, Satoshi Nawata, Carlos Nunez","  We explore the cosmological content of Salam-Sezgin six dimensional
supergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitative
agreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis
abundances, and recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The
carrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence
field slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is
a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold
dark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the
quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).
However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold
dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter
energy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of
supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure
constant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)
``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)
the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a
Robertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,
we present a String theory background by lifting our six dimensional
cosmological solution to ten dimensions.

Noncommutative Electromagnetism As A Large N Gauge Theory,Hyun Seok Yang,"  We map noncommutative (NC) U(1) gauge theory on R^d_C X R^{2n}_{NC} to U(N ->
\infty) Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C, where R^d_C is a d-dimensional commutative
spacetime while R^{2n}_{NC} is a 2n-dimensional NC space. The resulting U(N)
Yang-Mills theory on R^d_C is equivalent to that obtained by the dimensional
reduction of (d+2n)-dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills theory onto R^d_C. We show that
the gauge-Higgs system (A_\mu,\Phi^a) in the U(N -> \infty) Yang-Mills theory
on R^d_C leads to an emergent geometry in the (d+2n)-dimensional spacetime
whose metric was determined by Ward a long time ago. In particular, the
10-dimensional gravity for d=4 and n=3 corresponds to the emergent geometry
arising from the 4-dimensional N=4 vector multiplet in the AdS/CFT duality. We
further elucidate the emergent gravity by showing that the gauge-Higgs system
(A_\mu,\Phi^a) in half-BPS configurations describes self-dual Einstein gravity.

Marginal Solutions for the Superstring,Theodore Erler,"  We construct a class of analytic solutions of WZW-type open superstring field
theory describing marginal deformations of a reference D-brane background. The
deformations we consider are generated by on-shell vertex operators with
vanishing operator products. The superstring solution exhibits an intriguing
duality with the corresponding marginal solution of the {\it bosonic} string.
In particular, the superstring problem is ``dual'' to the problem of
re-expressing the bosonic marginal solution in pure gauge form. This represents
the first nonsingular analytic solution of open superstring field theory.

"The Isophotal Structure of Early-Type Galaxies in the SDSS: Dependence
  on AGN Activity and Environment","Anna Pasquali, Frank C. van den Bosch, Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA)","  We study the dependence of the isophotal shape of early-type galaxies on
their absolute B-band magnitude, their dynamical mass, and their nuclear
activity and environment, using an unprecedented large sample of 847 early-type
galaxies identified in the SDSS by Hao et al (2006). We find that the fraction
of disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large
sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear
relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the
isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations
between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the
optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group
hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be
accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy
luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,
nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape
of early-type galaxies.

"On the Origin of the Dichotomy of Early-Type Galaxies: The Role of Dry
  Mergers and AGN Feedback","Xi Kang, Frank C. van den Bosch, Anna Pasquali (MPIA)","  Using a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, combined with a large
N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

"Quantum and Classical Spins on the Spatially Distorted Kagome Lattice:
  Applications to Volborthite","Fa Wang, Ashvin Vishwanath, Yong Baek Kim","  In Volborthite, spin-1/2 moments form a distorted Kagom\'e lattice, of corner
sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

results illustrate the general features of the self-healing process: The onset
of the material fatigue is delayed, by developing a plateau-like
time-dependence of the material quality. We demonstrate that in this low-damage
regime, the changes in the conductance and similar transport/response
properties of the material can be used as measures of the material quality
degradation.

have apparently reached their time independent values. The mean number of
clusters whose size is comparable to the size of the nucleating droplet becomes
time independent at about the same time that the nucleation rate reaches its
constant value. We also find subtle structural differences between the
nucleating droplets formed before and after apparent metastable equilibrium has
been established.

during its 9 yr lifetime. We conducted an exhaustive search of the EGRET
archives and selected all the blazars that were observed multiple times and
were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law
models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6
low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral
index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for
spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.
There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in
five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS
1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral
dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We
observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in
all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were
available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the
widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in
the context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible
for emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps
that were regenerated to include the changes in performance during the mission.

linear potential, with a specified matching condition where the particles
overlap. This matching condition can be determined from the exactly-known
S-matrix for the sigma model.

"Recovering galaxy star formation and metallicity histories from spectra
  using VESPA","Rita Tojeiro (IfA, Edinburgh), Alan F. Heavens (IfA, Edinburgh), Raul
  Jimenez (UPenn), Ben Panter (IfA, Edinburgh)","  We introduce VErsatile SPectral Analysis (VESPA): a new method which aims to
recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.
VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic
models. We investigate the use of an adaptative parametrization grid to recover
reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is
robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed
to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we
detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic
and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the
number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on
the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young
population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover
between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA
and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.

Axiom A polynomial skew products of C^2 and their postcritical sets,Laura DeMarco and Suzanne Lynch Hruska,"  A polynomial skew product of C^2 is a map of the form f(z,w) = (p(z),
q(z,w)), where p and q are polynomials, such that f is regular of degree d >=
2. For polynomial maps of C, hyperbolicity is equivalent to the condition that
the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,
critical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For
polynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is
Axiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the
right analog of the Julia set. Here we present the analogous conclusion:
critical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.
In addition, we construct new examples of Axiom A maps demonstrating various
postcritical behaviors.

"Search for gravitational-wave bursts in LIGO data from the fourth
  science run",LIGO Scientific Collaboration,"  The fourth science run of the LIGO and GEO 600 gravitational-wave detectors,
carried out in early 2005, collected data with significantly lower noise than
previous science runs. We report on a search for short-duration
gravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the 64-1600 Hz frequency
range appearing in all three LIGO interferometers. Signal consistency tests,
data quality cuts, and auxiliary-channel vetoes are applied to reduce the rate
of spurious triggers. No gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days
of live observation time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 0.15 per day (at
90% confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to be
detected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search, characterized using
Monte Carlo simulations, is several times better than that of previous
searches. We also provide rough estimates of the distances at which
representative supernova and binary black hole merger signals could be detected
with 50% efficiency by this analysis.

annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic halo. We have used ""Via

gamma-ray counts from dark matter annihilation, assuming standard values of
particle mass and cross section. In this case GLAST should be able to detect
the Galactic center and several individual subhalos.

Gibbs fragmentation trees,"Peter McCullagh, Jim Pitman, Matthias Winkel","  We study fragmentation trees of Gibbs type. In the binary case, we identify
the most general Gibbs-type fragmentation tree with Aldous' beta-splitting
model, which has an extended parameter range $\beta>-2$ with respect to the
${\rm beta}(\beta+1,\beta+1)$ probability distributions on which it is based.
In the multifurcating case, we show that Gibbs fragmentation trees are
associated with the two-parameter Poisson--Dirichlet models for exchangeable
random partitions of $\mathbb {N}$, with an extended parameter range
$0\le\alpha\le1$, $\theta\ge-2\alpha$ and $\alpha<0$, $\theta =-m\alpha$, $m\in

Efficient Simulations of Early Structure Formation and Reionization,Andrei Mesinger and Steven Furlanetto,"  We present a method to construct semi-numerical ``simulations'', which can
efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at
high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with
first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear
density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our
algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding
and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with
radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean
hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to
date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We
show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such
large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical
approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation
and reionization.

Jet-disturbed molecular gas near the Seyfert 2 nucleus in M51,"Satoki Matsushita, Sebastien Muller, Jeremy Lim (ASIAA)","  Previous molecular gas observations at arcsecond-scale resolution of the
Seyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating
disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it
from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)
observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating
disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image
the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular
gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-
or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

Spectroscopy of Nine Cataclysmic Variable Stars,"H. A. Sheets, J. R. Thorstensen, C. J. Peters, A. B. Kapusta and C. J.
  Taylor","  We present optical spectroscopy of nine cataclysmic binary stars, mostly
dwarf novae, obtained primarily to determine orbital periods Porb. The stars
and their periods are LX And, 0.1509743(5) d; CZ Aql, 0.2005(6) d; LU Cam,
0.1499686(4) d; GZ Cnc, 0.0881(4) d; V632 Cyg, 0.06377(8) d; V1006 Cyg,
0.09903(9) d; BF Eri, 0.2708804(4) d; BI Ori, 0.1915(5) d; and FO Per, for
which Porb is either 0.1467(4) or 0.1719(5) d.
  Several of the stars proved to be especially interesting. In BF Eri, we
detect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1
subclass, which leads to a distance estimate of approximately 1 kpc. However,
BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary
parallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an
upper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and
it appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have
strong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a
magnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places
it squarely within the 2- to 3-hour ""gap"" in the distribution of cataclysmic
binary orbital periods.

Conservation laws for invariant functionals containing compositions,"Gastao S. F. Frederico, Delfim F. M. Torres","  The study of problems of the calculus of variations with compositions is a
quite recent subject with origin in dynamical systems governed by chaotic maps.
Available results are reduced to a generalized Euler-Lagrange equation that
contains a new term involving inverse images of the minimizing trajectories. In
this work we prove a generalization of the necessary optimality condition of
DuBois-Reymond for variational problems with compositions. With the help of the
new obtained condition, a Noether-type theorem is proved. An application of our
main result is given to a problem appearing in the chaotic setting when one
consider maps that are ergodic.

Displacement of the Sun from the Galactic Plane,Yogesh C. Joshi (Queen's University Belfast),"  We have carried out a comparative statistical study for the displacement of
the Sun from the Galactic plane (z_\odot) following three different methods.
The study has been done using a sample of 537 young open clusters (YOCs) with
log(Age) < 8.5 lying within a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and 2030 OB stars
observed up to a distance of 1200 pc, all of them have distance information. We
decompose the Gould Belt's member in a statistical sense before investigating
the variation in the z_\odot estimation with different upper cut-off limits in
the heliocentric distance and distance perpendicular to the Galactic plane. We
found z_\odot varies in a range of ~ 13 - 20 pc from the analys is of YOCs and
~ 6 - 18 pc from the OB stars. A significant scatter in the z_\odot obtained
due to different cut-off values is noticed for the OB stars although no such
deviation is seen for the YOCs. We also determined scale heights of
56.9(+3.8)(-3.4} and 61.4(+2.7)(-2.4) pc for the distribution of YOCs and OB
stars respectively.

Correlation amplitude and entanglement entropy in random spin chains,"J. A. Hoyos, Andr\'e P. Vieira, Nicolas Laflorencie, E. Miranda","  Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization,
and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ
spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the
average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon
l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent)
power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

  Galaxy Clusters","Lei Bai, Delphine Marcillac, George H. Rieke, Marcia J. Rieke, Kim-Vy
  H. Tran, Joannah L. Hinz, Gregory Rudnick, Douglas M. Kelly, Myra Blaylock","  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03
at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400
galaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are
selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

"Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed
  Consensus",Soummya Kar and Jose M. F. Moura,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

Charges from Attractors,Nemani V. Suryanarayana and Matthias C. Wapler,"  We describe how to recover the quantum numbers of extremal black holes from
their near horizon geometries. This is achieved by constructing the
gravitational Noether-Wald charges which can be used for non-extremal black
holes as well. These charges are shown to be equivalent to the U(1) charges of
appropriately dimensionally reduced solutions. Explicit derivations are
provided for 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity and 5 dimensional minimal
gauged supergravity, with illustrative examples for various black hole
solutions. We also discuss how to derive the thermodynamic quantities and their
relations explicitly in the extremal limit, from the point of view of the
near-horizon geometry. We relate our results to the entropy function formalism.

"Nodeless d-wave superconducting pairing due to residual
  antiferromagnetism in underdoped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$","Tanmoy Das, R. S. Markiewicz, A. Bansil","  We have investigated the doping dependence of the penetration depth vs.
temperature in electron doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ using a model
which assumes the uniform coexistence of (mean-field) antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity. Despite the presence of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing gap in the
underlying spectrum, we find nodeless behavior of the low-$T$ penetration depth
in underdoped case, in accord with experimental results. As doping increases, a
linear-in-$T$ behavior of the penetration depth, characteristic of d-wave
pairing, emerges as the lower magnetic band crosses the Fermi level and creates
a nodal Fermi surface pocket.
"
One-dimensional Brownian particle systems with rank dependent drifts,Soumik Pal and Jim Pitman,"  We study interacting systems of linear Brownian motions whose drift vector at
every time point is determined by the relative ranks of the coordinate
processes at that time. Our main objective has been to study the long range
behavior of the spacings between the Brownian motions arranged in increasing
order. For finitely many Brownian motions interacting in this manner, we
characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is
tight, and show its convergence to a unique stationary joint distribution given
by independent exponential distributions with varying means. We also study one
particular countably infinite system, where only the minimum Brownian particle
gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically
distributed exponential spacings remain stationary under the dynamics of such a
process. Some related conjectures in this direction have also been discussed.

November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

Generating Squeezed States of Nanomechanical Resonator,Wen Yi Huo and Gui Lu Long,"  We propose a scheme for generating squeezed states in solid state circuits
consisting of a nanomechanical resonator (NMR), a superconducting Cooper-pair
box (CPB) and a superconducting transmission line resonator (STLR). The
nonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by
setting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction
Hamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\rm\ddot
o$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by
adiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard
parametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear
media"", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner
similar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave
mixing in a solid-state circuit.

of low accretion rate polars (LARPs) in order to test if they undergo high
luminosity states similar to ordinary polars. On the basis of that short
observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar
(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin
period appeared to be quite unusual. Aims: We performed follow-up observations
of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic
and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of
radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and
brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:
New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital
and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of
confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission
line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.

Nova Geminorum 1912 and the Origin of the Idea of Gravitational Lensing,Tilman Sauer,"  Einstein's early calculations of gravitational lensing, contained in a
scratch notebook and dated to the spring of 1912, are reexamined. A hitherto
unknown letter by Einstein suggests that he entertained the idea of explaining
the phenomenon of new stars by gravitational lensing in the fall of 1915 much
more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational
lensing in the fall of 1915 for the reconstruction of Einstein's final steps in
his path towards general relativity.

Upper bounds on entangling rates of bipartite Hamiltonians,Sergey Bravyi,"  We discuss upper bounds on the rate at which unitary evolution governed by a
non-local Hamiltonian can generate entanglement in a bipartite system. Given a
bipartite Hamiltonian H coupling two finite dimensional particles A and B, the
entangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is
the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator
norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the
initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct
Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large
multiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional
measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent
state with a state evolving unitarily.

Separability Criterion for Multipartite Pure States,Zongwen Yu and Su Hu,"  In this paper, we give out some effective criterions which can be used to
judge the separability of multipartite pure states. We obtain the relationship
between separability and Schmidt decomposable of multipartite pure states in
Theorem1. The first criterion derived from Theorem2 dose not need the Schmidt
decomposition which is hard to find for multipartite states. Theorem3 is more
profound which can be used to deduce Corollary1 which is one of the main
results in [1]. Finally, we give out an algorithm which can be used to judge
the separability of multipartite pure states effectively.

"Cross-Layer Optimization of MIMO-Based Mesh Networks with Gaussian
  Vector Broadcast Channels",Jia Liu and Y. Thomas Hou,"  MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to
increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity
for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each
node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient
method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network
performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

  Follow-Up Observation",Cheongho Han (Chunguk Natl. Univ.),"  To provide criteria in the selection of target events preferable for
planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the
lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we
consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim
10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars
with magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.

"The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Separability for Bipartite
  Pure States in Infinite Dimensional Hilbert Spaces",Su Hu and Zongwen Yu,"  In this paper, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions of
separability for bipartite pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Let $M$ be the matrix of the amplitudes of $\ket\psi$, we prove $M$ is a
compact operator. We also prove $\ket\psi$ is separable if and only if $M$ is a
bounded linear operator with rank 1, that is the image of $M$ is a one
dimensional Hilbert space. So we have related the separability for bipartite
pure states in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces to an important class of
bounded linear operators in Functional analysis which has many interesting
properties.

Magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks,Mark Wardle (Macquarie University),"  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of
protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

"D0-anti-D0 Mixing and CP Violation in D0 vs anti-D0 to K*(+-) K(-+)
  Decays",Zhi-zhong Xing and Shun Zhou,"  The noteworthy BaBar and Belle evidence for $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing
motivates us to study its impact on $D^0\to K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ decays and their
CP-conjugate processes. We show that both the $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing
parameters ($x$ and $y$) and the strong phase difference between $\bar{D}^0\to
K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ and $D^0\to K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ transitions ($\delta$) can be
determined or constrained from the time-dependent measurements of these decay
modes. On the $\psi (3770)$ and $\psi (4140)$ resonances at a $\tau$-charm
factory, it is even possible to determine or constrain $x$, $y$ and $\delta$
from the time-independent measurements of coherent $(D^0\bar{D}^0) \to
(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)$ decays. If the CP-violating phase of
$D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing is significant in a scenario beyond the standard
model, it can also be extracted from the $K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ events.

"The dissolution of the vacancy gas and grain boundary diffusion in
  crystalline solids",Fedor V.Prigara,"  Based on the formula for the number density of vacancies in a solid under the
stress or tension, the model of grain boundary diffusion in crystalline solids
is developed. We obtain the activation energy of grain boundary diffusion
(dependent on the surface tension or the energy of the grain boundary) and also
the distributions of vacancies and the diffusing species in the vicinity of the
grain boundary.

"X-ray Timing Observations of PSR J1930+1852 in the Crab-like SNR
  G54.1+0.3","Fangjun Lu, Q.Daniel Wang, E. V. Gotthelf, and Jinlu Qu","  We present new X-ray timing and spectral observations of PSR J1930+1852, the
young energetic pulsar at the center of the non-thermal supernova remnant
G54.1+0.3. Using data obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and Chandra
X-ray observatories we have derived an updated timing ephemeris of the 136 ms
pulsar spanning 6 years. During this interval, however, the period evolution
shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise
and/or glitch activity. The X-ray emission is highly pulsed ($71\pm5%$
modulation) and is characterized by an asymmetric, broad profile ($\sim 70%$
duty cycle) which is nearly twice the radio width. The spectrum of the pulsed
emission is well fitted with an absorbed power law of photon index $\Gamma =
1.2\pm0.2$; this is marginally harder than that of the unpulsed component. The
total 2-10 keV flux of the pulsar is $1.7 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. These results confirm PSR J1930+1852 as a typical Crab-like pulsar.

"Vortex-induced topological transition of the bilinear-biquadratic
  Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice",Hikaru Kawamura and Atsushi Yamamoto,"  The ordering of the classical Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular
lattice with the the bilinear-biquadratic interaction is studied by Monte Carlo
simulations. It is shown that the model exhibits a topological phase transition
at a finite-temperature driven by topologically stable vortices, while the spin
correlation length remains finite even at and below the transition point. The
relevant vortices could be of three different types, depending on the value of
the biquadratic coupling. Implications to recent experiments on the triangular
antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$ is discussed.

Recurrence analysis of the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect,"A. Sarkar, Charles L. Webber Jr., P. Barat, P. Mukherjee","  Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of
Al-2.5%Mg alloy at room temperature in a wide range of strain rates where the
Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was observed. The experimental stress-time
series data have been analyzed using the recurrence analysis technique based on
the Recurrence Plot (RP) and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to
study the change in the dynamical behavior of the PLC effect with the imposed
strain rate. Our study revealed that the RQA is able to detect the unique
crossover phenomenon in the PLC dynamics.

A Topological Glass,Jean-Pierre Eckmann,"  We propose and study a model with glassy behavior. The state space of the
model is given by all triangulations of a sphere with $n$ nodes, half of which
are red and half are blue. Red nodes want to have 5 neighbors while blue ones
want 7. Energies of nodes with different numbers of neighbors are supposed to
be positive. The dynamics is that of flipping the diagonal of two adjacent
triangles, with a temperature dependent probability. We show that this system
has an approach to a steady state which is exponentially slow, and show that
the stationary state is unordered. We also study the local energy landscape and
show that it has the hierarchical structure known from spin glasses. Finally,
we show that the evolution can be described as that of a rarefied gas with
spontaneous generation of particles and annihilating collisions.

"Anomalous pressure behavior of tangential modes in single-wall carbon
  nanotubes","Wei Yang, Ru-Zhi Wang, Yu-Fang Wang, Xue-Mei Song, Bo Wang, Hui Yan","  Using the molecular dynamics simulations and the force constant model we have
studied the Raman-active tangential modes (TMs) of a (10, 0) single-wall carbon
nanotube (SWNT) under hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, the
atomic motions in the three TMs present obvious diversities. The pressure
derivative of E1g, A1g, and E2g mode frequency shows an increased value (), a
constant value (), and a negative value () above 5.3 GPa, respectively. The
intrinsic characteristics of TMs consumedly help to understand the essence of
the experimental T band of CNT. The anomalous pressure behavior of the TMs
frequencies may be originated from the tube symmetry alteration from D10h to
D2h then to C2h.

"Distribution of the molecular absorption in front of the quasar
  B0218+357","S. Muller, M. Guelin, F. Combes, T. Wiklind","  The line of sight to the quasar B0218+357, one of the most studied lensed
systems, intercepts a z=0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into two
main components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3'', and gives rise to molecular
absorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in
front of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other
velocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this
question, we have observed the HCO+(2-1) absorption line during the
commissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a
function of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed
us to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component.
Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of
the HCO+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the
quasar. We estimate a flux ratio fA/fB = 4.2 (-1.0;+1.8 at 106 GHz.

"Cosmogenic neutrinos as a probe of the transition from Galactic to
  extragalactic cosmic rays","Hajime Takami, Kohta Murase, Shigehiro Nagataki, and Katsuhiko Sato","  There are two promising scenarios that explain the ankle, which is a dip in
the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the
ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

Spin state mixing in InAs double quantum dots,"A. Pfund, I. Shorubalko, K. Ensslin, R. Leturcq","  We quantify the contributions of hyperfine and spin-orbit mediated
singlet-triplet mixing in weakly coupled InAs quantum dots by electron
transport spectroscopy in the Pauli spin blockade regime. In contrast to double
dots in GaAs, the spin-orbit coupling is found to be more than two orders of
magnitudes larger than the hyperfine mixing energy. It is already effective at
magnetic fields of a few mT, where deviations from hyperfine mixing are
observed.

Daemons and DAMA: Their Celestial-Mechanics Interrelations,Edward M. Drobyshevski and Mikhail E. Drobyshevski,"  The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged
Planckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by
the St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here
the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

Transfer of a Polaritonic Qubit through a Coupled Cavity Array,"Sougato Bose, Dimitris G. Angelakis, Daniel Burgarth","  We demonstrate a scheme for quantum communication between the ends of an
array of coupled cavities. Each cavity is doped with a single two level system
(atoms or quantum dots) and the detuning of the atomic level spacing and
photonic frequency is appropriately tuned to achieve photon blockade in the
array. We show that in such a regime, the array can simulate a dual rail
quantum state transfer protocol where the arrival of quantum information at the
receiving cavity is heralded through a fluorescence measurement. Communication
is also possible between any pair of cavities of a network of connected
cavities.

Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems,"Mohd Abubakr, R.M.Vinay","  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing
complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel
techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot
of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems
can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal
systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the
system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An
embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our
method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and
autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this
architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.

"On reference frames in spacetime and gravitational energy in freely
  falling frames","J. W. Maluf, F. F. Faria and S. C. Ulhoa","  We consider the interpretation of tetrad fields as reference frames in
spacetime. Reference frames may be characterized by an antisymmetric
acceleration tensor, whose components are identified as the inertial
accelerations of the frame (the translational acceleration and the frequency of
rotation of the frame). This tensor is closely related to
gravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields
adapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and
show that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of
tetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general
relatrivity, vanishes. This result is in agreement with the principle of
equivalence, and may be taken as a condition for a viable definition of
gravitational energy.

"A kind of prediction from string phenomenology: extra matter at low
  energy",C. Munoz,"  We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises from
orbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and the
phenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular,
trying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the
Heterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP
experiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of
three families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies
on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,
together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an
interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable
lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined
with other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled
way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear
when fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with
several Higgs doublets. We will address this potential problem, finding that
viable scenarios can be obtained for a reasonable light Higgs spectrum.

Evidence for a Massive Protocluster in S255N,"C.J. Cyganowski, C.L. Brogan, T.R. Hunter","  S255N is a luminous far-infrared source that contains many indications of
active star formation but lacks a prominent near-infrared stellar cluster. We
present mid-infrared through radio observations aimed at exploring the
evolutionary state of this region. Our observations include 1.3mm continuum and
spectral line data from the Submillimeter Array, VLA 3.6cm continuum and 1.3cm
water maser data, and multicolor IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is
clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm
continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are
dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core
(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region
and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1
also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young
hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further
multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the
northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely
traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct
evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

Enumerating limit groups,"Daniel Groves, Henry Wilton","  We prove that the set of limit groups is recursive, answering a question of
Delzant. One ingredient of the proof is the observation that a finitely
presented group with local retractions (a la Long and Reid) is coherent and,
furthermore, there exists an algorithm that computes presentations for finitely
generated subgroups. The other main ingredient is the ability to
algorithmically calculate centralizers in relatively hyperbolic groups.
Applications include the existence of recognition algorithms for limit groups
and free groups.

"Dynamics of Size-Selected Gold Nanoparticles Studied by Ultrafast
  Electron Nanocrystallography","Chong-Yu Ruan, Yoshie Murooka, Ramani K. Raman, Ryan A. Murdick","  We report the studies of ultrafast electron nanocrystallography on
size-selected Au nanoparticles (2-20 nm) supported on a molecular interface.
Reversible surface melting, melting, and recrystallization were investigated
with dynamical full-profile radial distribution functions determined with
sub-picosecond and picometer accuracies. In an ultrafast photoinduced melting,
the nanoparticles are driven to a non-equilibrium transformation, characterized
by the initial lattice deformations, nonequilibrium electron-phonon coupling,
and upon melting, the collective bonding and debonding, transforming
nanocrystals into shelled nanoliquids. The displasive structural excitation at
premelting and the coherent transformation with crystal/liquid coexistence
during photomelting differ from the reciprocal behavior of recrystallization,
where a hot lattice forms from liquid and then thermally contracts. The degree
of structural change and the thermodynamics of melting are found to depend on
the size of nanoparticle.

"A Direct Method for Solving Optimal Switching Problems of
  One-Dimensional Diffusions",Masahiko Egami,"  In this paper, we propose a direct solution method for optimal switching
problems of one-dimensional diffusions. This method is free from conjectures
about the form of the value function and switching strategies, or does not
require the proof of optimality through quasi-variational inequalities. The
direct method uses a general theory of optimal stopping problems for
one-dimensional diffusions and characterizes the value function as sets of the
smallest linear majorants in their respective transformed spaces.

nonlinear perturbation theory we show in both cases that solutions having
smooth compactly supported initial data posses tails which decay as $t^{-4}$ at

derive the third-order formula for the amplitude of the tail and confirm
numerically its accuracy.

Mediatic graphs,"J.-Cl. Falmagne, S. Ovchinnikov","  Any medium can be represented as an isometric subgraph of the hypercube, with
each token of the medium represented by a particular equivalence class of arcs
of the subgraph. Such a representation, although useful, is not especially
revealing of the structure of a particular medium. We propose an axiomatic
definition of the concept of a `mediatic graph'. We prove that the graph of any
medium is a mediatic graph. We also show that, for any non-necessarily finite
set S, there exists a bijection from the collection M of all the media on a
given set S (of states) onto the collection G of all the mediatic graphs on S.

Composite Structure and Causality,Satish D. Joglekar,"  We study the question of whether a composite structure of elementary
particles, with a length scale $1/\Lambda$, can leave observable effects of
non-locality and causality violation at higher energies (but $\lesssim
\Lambda$). We formulate a model-independent approach based on
Bogoliubov-Shirkov formulation of causality. We analyze the relation between
the fundamental theory (of finer constituents) and the derived theory (of
composite particles). We assume that the fundamental theory is causal and
formulate a condition which must be fulfilled for the derived theory to be
causal. We analyze the condition and exhibit possibilities which fulfil and
which violate the condition. We make comments on how causality violating
amplitudes can arise.

Brane World Black Rings,"Anurag Sahay, Gautam Sengupta","  Five dimensional neutral rotating black rings are described from a
Randall-Sundrum brane world perspective in the bulk black string framework. To
this end we consider a rotating black string extension of a five dimensional
black ring into the bulk of a six dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world with
a single four brane. The bulk solution intercepts the four brane in a five
dimensional black ring with the usual curvature singularity on the brane. The
bulk geodesics restricted to the plane of rotation of the black ring are
constructed and their projections on the four brane match with the usual black
ring geodesics restricted to the same plane. The asymptotic nature of the bulk
geodesics are elucidated with reference to a bulk singularity at the AdS
horizon. We further discuss the description of a brane world black ring as a
limit of a boosted bulk black 2 brane with periodic identification.

$f=q_1e^p+q_2$, where $p$ is a polynomial and $q_1,q_2$ are rational functions.
In the latter case, $h/g$ belongs to the algebra generated by the rational

"Test vectors for trilinear forms, when two representations are
  unramified and one is special",Louise Nyssen (I3M),"  Let F be a finite extension of Qp and G be GL(2,F). When V is the tensor
product of three admissible, irreducible, finite dimensional representations of
G, the space of G-invariant linear forms has dimension at most one. When a non
zero linear form exists, one wants to find an element of V which is not in its
kernel: this is a test vector. Gross and Prasad found explicit test vectors for
some triple of representations. In this paper, others are found, and they
almost complete the case when the conductor of each representation is at most
1.

Measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0->Ks pi+ pi- decays,"L.M. Zhang, et al (for the Belle Collaboration)","  We report a measurement of D0-D0bar mixing in D0->Ks pi+ pi- decays using a
time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis. We first assume CP conservation and
subsequently allow for CP violation. The results are based on 540 fb$^{-1}$ of
data accumulated with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider.
Assuming negligible CP violation, we measure the mixing parameters
$x=(0.80\pm0.29^{+0.09 +0.10}_{-0.07 -0.14})%$ and $y=(0.33\pm0.24^{+0.08
+0.06}_{-0.12 -0.08})%$, where the errors are statistical, experimental
systematic, and systematic due to the Dalitz decay model, respectively.
Allowing for CP violation, we obtain the $CPV$ parameters $|q/p|=0.86^{+0.30

Tautological relations in Hodge field theory,"A. Losev, S. Shadrin, I. Shneiberg","  We propose a Hodge field theory construction that captures algebraic

  We prove the main theorem stating that algebraically defined Hodge field
theory correlators satisfy all tautological relations. From this perspective
the statement that Barannikov-Kontsevich construction provides a solution of
the WDVV equation looks as the simplest particular case of our theorem. Also it
generalizes the particular cases of other low-genera tautological relations
proven in our earlier works; we replace the old technical proofs by a novel
conceptual proof.

real CCD frames. In addition to the physical properties of the simulated

Constructions of Kahler-Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature,Jian Song and Ben Weinkove,"  We show that on Kahler manifolds with negative first Chern class, the
sequence of algebraic metrics introduced by H. Tsuji converges uniformly to the
Kahler-Einstein metric. For algebraic surfaces of general type and orbifolds
with isolated singularities, we prove a convergence result for a modified
version of Tsuji's iterative construction.

commuting circle diffeomorphisms respectively of class C^(1+\tau_k), where
\tau_1 + ... + \tau_k > 1, then these maps are simultaneously conjugate to
rotations provided that their rotation numbers are independent over the

"Transient Dynamics of Sparsely Connected Hopfield Neural Networks with
  Arbitrary Degree Distributions",Pan Zhang and Yong Chen,"  Using probabilistic approach, the transient dynamics of sparsely connected
Hopfield neural networks is studied for arbitrary degree distributions. A
recursive scheme is developed to determine the time evolution of overlap
parameters. As illustrative examples, the explicit calculations of dynamics for
networks with binomial, power-law, and uniform degree distribution are
performed. The results are good agreement with the extensive numerical
simulations. It indicates that with the same average degree, there is a gradual
improvement of network performance with increasing sharpness of its degree
distribution, and the most efficient degree distribution for global storage of
patterns is the delta function.

Explicit HRS-Tilting,Behrang Noohi,"  For an abelian category $A$ equipped with a torsion pair, we give an explicit
description for the abelian category $B$ introduced by Happel-Reiten-Smalo, and
also for the category of chain complexes $Ch(B)$ and the derived category
$D(B)$ of $B$. We also describe the DG structure on $Ch(B)$. As a consequence,
we find new proofs of certain results of Happel-Reiten-Smalo. The main
ingredient is the category of {\em decorated} complexes.

Group actions on algebraic stacks via butterflies,Behrang Noohi,"  We introduce an explicit method for studying actions of a group stack G on an
algebraic stack X. As an example, we study in detail the case where
X=P(n_0,...,n_r) is a weighted projective stack over an arbitrary base S. To
this end, we give an explicit description of the group stack of automorphisms
of, the weighted projective general linear 2-group PGL(n_0,...,n_r). As an
application, we use a result of Colliot-Thelene to show that for every linear
algebraic group G over an arbitrary base field k (assumed to be reductive if
char(k)>0) such that Pic}(G)=0, every action of G on P(n_0,...,n_r) lifts to a
linear action of G on A^{r+1}.

Modal Extraction in Spatially Extended Systems,"Kapilanjan Krishan, Andreas Handel, Roman O. Grigoriev, Michael F.
  Schatz","  We describe a practical procedure for extracting the spatial structure and
the growth rates of slow eigenmodes of a spatially extended system, using a
unique experimental capability both to impose and to perturb desired initial
states. The procedure is used to construct experimentally the spectrum of
linear modes near the secondary instability boundary in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard
convection. This technique suggests an approach to experimental
characterization of more complex dynamical states such as periodic orbits or
spatiotemporal chaos.
"
Unstable and Stable Galaxy Models,Yan Guo and Zhiwu Lin,"  To determine the stability and instability of a given steady galaxy
configuration is one of the fundamental problems in the Vlasov theory for
galaxy dynamics. In this article, we study the stability of isotropic spherical
symmetric galaxy models $f_{0}(E)$, for which the distribution function $f_{0}$
depends on the particle energy $E$ only. In the first part of the article, we
derive the first sufficient criterion for linear instability of $f_{0}(E):$
$f_{0}(E)$ is linearly unstable if the second-order operator \[
A_{0}\equiv-\Delta+4\pi\int f_{0}^{\prime}(E)\{I-\mathcal{P}\}dv \] has a
negative direction, where $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection onto the function
space $\{g(E,L)\},$ $L$ being the angular momentum [see the explicit formula
(\ref{A0-radial})]. In the second part of the article, we prove that for the
important King model, the corresponding $A_{0}$ is positive definite. Such a
positivity leads to the nonlinear stability of the King model under all
spherically symmetric perturbations.

Phenomenological theory of spin excitations in La- and Y-based cuprates,"T. Zhou, Z. D. Wang","  Motivated by recent inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on
La-based cuprates and based on the fermiology theories, we study the spin
susceptibility for La-based (e.g., La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$) and Y-based (e.g.,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$) cuprates, respectively. The spin excitation in
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40
meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, the
incommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreases
dramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur and
the IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation of
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,
namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of the
superconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. The
spectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)
while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale at
the frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate and
local maximum at this frequency. We elaborate all the results based on the
Fermi surface topology and the d-wave superconductivity, and suggest that the
spin-stripe order be also important in determining the spin excitation of
La-based cuprates. A coherent picture for the spin excitations is presented for
Y-based and La-based cuprates.

"Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
  model on the kagome lattice and experimental data on ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2",Gregoire Misguich and Philippe Sindzingre,"  We compute the magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of the spin-1/2
Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with high-temperature expansions and
exact diagonalizations. We compare the results with the experimental data on
ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 obtained by Helton et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 107204 (2007)].
Down to k_BT/J~0.2, our calculations reproduce accurately the experimental
susceptibility, with an exchange interaction J~190K and a contribution of 3.7%
of weakly interacting impurity spins. The comparison between our calculations
of the specific heat and the experiments indicate that the low-temperature
entropy (below ~20K) is smaller in ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 than in the kagome Heisenberg
model, a likely signature of other interactions in the system.

"Environmental dielectric screening effect on exciton transition energies
  in single-walled carbon nanotubes","Yutaka Ohno, Shinya Iwasaki, Yoichi Murakami, Shigeru Kishimoto,
  Shigeo Maruyama, and Takashi Mizutani","  Environmental dielectric screening effects on exciton transition energies in
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied quantitatively in the
range of dielectric constants from 1.0 to 37 by immersing SWNTs bridged over
trenches in various organic solvents by means of photoluminescence and the
excitation spectroscopies. With increasing environmental dielectric constant
($\epsilon_{\rm env}$), both $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ exhibited a redshift by
several tens meV and a tendency to saturate at a $\epsilon_{\rm env} \sim 5$
without an indication of significant ($n$,$m$) dependence. The redshifts can be
explained by dielectric screening of the repulsive electron-electron
interaction. The $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ dependence of $E_{11}$ and $E_{22}$ can
be expressed by a simple empirical equation with a power law in $\epsilon_{\rm
env}$, $E_{\rm ii} = E_{\rm ii}^{\infty} + A\epsilon_{\rm env}^{-\alpha}$. We
also immersed a sample in sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) solution to investigate
the effects of wrapping SWNTs with surfactant. The resultant $E_{11}$ and
$E_{22}$, which agree well with Weisman's data [Nano Lett. {\bf 3}, 1235
(2003)], are close to those of $\epsilon_{\rm env}$ of 2. However, in addition
to the shift due to dielectric screening, another shift was observed so that
the ($2n+m$)-family patterns spread more widely, similar to that of the
uniaxial-stress-induced shift.

Cyclic cohomology of certain nuclear Fr\'echet and DF algebras,"Zinaida A. Lykova (Newcastle University, England)","  We give explicit formulae for the continuous Hochschild and cyclic homology

$DF$-spaces, the isomorphism of cohomology groups $H^n(\phi): H^n(\X) \to
H^n(\Y)$ is automatically topological. The continuous cyclic-type homology and

"
The on-line shortest path problem under partial monitoring,"Andras Gyorgy, Tamas Linder, Gabor Lugosi, Gyorgy Ottucsak","  The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of
partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

environment. We prove an invariance principle (functional central limit
theorem) under almost every environment for the centered and diffusively scaled

of the walk behaves subdiffusively.

"The Effect of Annealing Temperature on Statistical Properties of $WO_3$
  Surface","G. R. Jafari, A. A. Saberi, R. Azimirad, A. Z. Moshfegh, and S.
  Rouhani","  We have studied the effect of annealing temperature on the statistical
properties of $WO_3$ surface using atomic force microscopy techniques (AFM). We
have applied both level crossing and structure function methods. Level crossing
analysis indicates an optimum annealing temperature of around 400$^oC$ at which
the effective area of the $WO_3$ thin film is maximum, whereas composition of
the surface remains stoichiometric. The complexity of the height fluctuation of
surfaces was characterized by roughness, roughness exponent and lateral size of
surface features. We have found that there is a phase transition at around
400$^oC$ from one set to two sets of roughness parameters. This happens due to
microstructural changes from amorphous to crystalline structure in the samples
that has been already found experimentally.

"Determination of Low-Energy Parameters of Neutron--Proton Scattering on
  the Basis of Modern Experimental Data from Partial-Wave Analyses",V. A. Babenko and N. M. Petrov,"  The triplet and singlet low-energy parameters in the effective-range
expansion for neutron--proton scattering are determined by using the latest
experimental data on respective phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon
database. The results differ markedly from the analogous parameters obtained on
the basis of the phase shifts of the Nijmegen group and contradict the
parameter values that are presently used as experimental ones. The values found
with the aid of the phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon database for
the total cross section for the scattering of zero-energy neutrons by protons,
$\sigma_{0}=20.426 $b, and the neutron--proton coherent scattering length,
$f=-3.755 $fm, agree perfectly with the experimental cross-section values
obtained by Houk, $\sigma_{0}=20.436\pm 0.023 $b, and experimental
scattering-length values obtained by Houk and Wilson, $f=-3.756\pm 0.009 $fm,
but they contradict cross-section values of $\sigma_{0}=20.491\pm 0.014 $b
according to Dilg and coherent-scattering-length values of $f=-3.7409\pm 0.0011
$fm according to Koester and Nistler.

The Measure for the Multiverse and the Probability for Inflation,"Miao Li, Yi Wang","  We investigate the measure problem in the framework of inflationary

inflation models. Using this measure, it is shown that the probability for the
generalized single field slow roll inflation to last for $N$ e-folds is
suppressed by a factor $\exp(-3N)$, and the probability for the generalized
$n$-field slow roll inflation is suppressed by a much larger factor
$\exp(-3nN)$. Some non-inflationary models such as the cyclic model do not
suffer from this difficulty.

$B_s^0 \to \eta^{(\prime)} \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays in the pQCD approach,"Xin Liu, Zhen-Jun Xiao, Hui-Sheng Wang","  We calculate the CP averaged branching ratios and CP-violating asymmetries
for $B_s^0 \to \eta \eta, \eta \eta^\prime$ and $\eta^\prime \eta^\prime$
decays in the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach here. The pQCD predictions for
the CP-averaged branching ratios are $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta \eta) = \left
(14.2^{+18.0}_{-7.5}) \times 10^{-6}$, $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta \eta^\prime)= \left
(12.4 ^{+18.2}_{-7.0}) \times 10^{-6}$, and $Br(B_s^0 \to \eta^{\prime}
\eta^{\prime}) = \left (9.2^{+15.3}_{-4.9}) \times 10^{-6}$, which agree well
with those obtained by employing the QCD factorization approach and also be
consistent with available experimental upper limits. The gluonic contributions
are small in size: less than 7% for $B_s \to \eta \eta$ and $ \eta \eta^\prime$
decays, and around 18% for $B_s \to \eta' \eta'$ decay. The CP-violating
asymmetries for three decays are very small: less than 3% in magnitude.

A neural network approach to ordinal regression,Jianlin Cheng,"  Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of
both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective
approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our
approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.
On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network
classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using
Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable
performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural
networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training
datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and
complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information
retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in
Bioinformatics.

evaluated at period matrix of $R,$ a cyclic 3 sheeted cover of the sphere with
$3k$ branch points $\lambda_1...\lambda_{3k}.$ These identities follow from
Thomae formula \cite{BR}. This formula expresses powers of theta constants as

Topology of spaces of equivariant symplectic embeddings,Alvaro Pelayo,"  We compute the homotopy type of the space of T^n-equivariant symplectic
embeddings from the standard 2n-dimensional ball of some fixed radius into a
2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifold M, and use this computation to define
a Z-valued step function on the positive real line which is an invariant of the
symplectic-toric type of M. We conclude with a discussion of the partially
equivariant case of this result.

Toric symplectic ball packing,Alvaro Pelayo,"  We define and solve the toric version of the symplectic ball packing problem,
in the sense of listing all 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds which
admit a perfect packing by balls embedded in a symplectic and torus equivariant
fashion.
  In order to do this we first describe a problem in geometric-combinatorics
which is equivalent to the toric symplectic ball packing problem. Then we solve
this problem using arguments from Convex Geometry and Delzant theory.
  Applications to symplectic blowing-up are also presented, and some further
questions are raised in the last section.

Anisotropic brane gravity with a confining potential,M. Heydari-Fard and H. R. Sepangi,"  We consider an anisotropic brane world with Bianchi type I and V geometries
where the mechanism of confining the matter on the brane is through the use of
a confining potential. The resulting equations on the anisotropic brane are
modified by an extra term that may be interpreted as the x-matter, providing a
possible phenomenological explanation for the accelerated expansion of the
universe. We obtain the general solution of the field equations in an exact
parametric form for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the special case
of a Bianchi type I the solutions of the field equations are obtained in an
exact analytic form. Finally, we study the behavior of the observationally
important parameters.
"
Maximal ball packings of symplectic-toric manifolds,Alvaro Pelayo and Benjamin Schmidt,"  Let M be a symplectic-toric manifold of dimension at least four. This paper
investigates the so called symplectic ball packing problem in the toral
equivariant setting. We show that the set of toric symplectic ball packings of
M admits the structure of a convex polytope. Previous work of the first author
shows that up to equivalence, only CP^1 x CP^1 and CP^2 admit density one
packings when n=2 and only CP^n admits density one packings when n>2. In
contrast, we show that for a fixed n>=2 and each r in (0, 1), there are
uncountably many inequivalent 2n-dimensional symplectic-toric manifolds with a
maximal toric packing of density r. This result follows from a general analysis
of how the densities of maximal packings change while varying a given
symplectic-toric manifold through a family of symplectic-toric manifolds that
are equivariantly diffeomorphic but not equivariantly symplectomorphic.

"Controlled collisions of a single atom and ion guided by movable
  trapping potentials","Z. Idziaszek, T. Calarco, P. Zoller","  We consider a system composed of a trapped atom and a trapped ion. The ion
charge induces in the atom an electric dipole moment, which attracts it with an
r^{-4} dependence at large distances. In the regime considered here, the
characteristic range of the atom-ion interaction is comparable or larger than
the characteristic size of the trapping potential, which excludes the
application of the contact pseudopotential. The short-range part of the
interaction is described in the framework of quantum-defect theory, by
introducing some short-range parameters, which can be related to the s-wave
scattering length. When the separation between traps is changed we observe
trap-induced shape resonances between molecular bound states and vibrational
states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to
quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit
confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for
short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the
effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which
occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we
show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control
and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules.

Counting BPS operators in N=4 SYM,F.A. Dolan,"  The free field partition function for a generic U(N) gauge theory, where the
fundamental fields transform in the adjoint representation, is analysed in
terms of symmetric polynomial techniques. It is shown by these means how this
is related to the cycle polynomial for the symmetric group and how the large N
result may be easily recovered. Higher order corrections for finite N are also
discussed in terms of symmetric group characters. For finite N, the partition
function involving a single bosonic fundamental field is recovered and explicit
counting of multi-trace quarter BPS operators in free \N=4 super Yang Mills
discussed, including a general result for large N. The partition function for
BPS operators in the chiral ring of \N=4 super Yang Mills is analysed in terms
of plane partitions. Asymptotic counting of BPS primary operators with
differing R-symmetry charges is discussed in both free \N=4 super Yang Mills
and in the chiral ring. Also, general and explicit expressions are derived for
SU(2) gauge theory partition functions, when the fundamental fields transform
in the adjoint, for free field theory.

"Recent Results on Thermal Casimir Force between Dielectrics and Related
  Problems","B. Geyer, G.L. Klimchitskaya, V.M. Mostepanenko","  We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force
acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all
present experiments.

Entangling and disentangling capacities of nonlocal maps,Berry Groisman,"  Entangling and disentangling capacities are the key manifestation of the

"
On the Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity for short sequences,Jean-Paul Delahaye and Hector Zenil,"  A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the
shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of
applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a
particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can
approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable
definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.
Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found
across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional
cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.
"
The redshift and geometrical aspect of photons,Hongjun Pan,"  The cosmological redshift phenomenon can be described by the dark matter
field fluid model, the results deduced from this model agree very well with the
observations. The observed cosmological redshift of light depends on both the
speed of the emitter and the distance between the emitter and the observer. If
the emitter moves away from us, a redshift is observed. If the emitter moves
towards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will depend
on the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range of
c(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equals
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less than
c(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observed
in all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from us
is large enough. Therefore, many more redshifts than blueshifts should be
observed for galaxies and supernovae, etc in the sky. This conclusion agrees
with current observations. The estimated value of the redshift constant beta of
the dark matter field fluid is in the range of 10^(-3) ~ 10^(-5)/Mpc. A large
redshift value from a distant celestial object may not necessarily indicate
that it has a large receding speed. Based on the redshift effect of dark matter
field fluid, it is concluded that at least in time average all photons have the
same geometry (size and shape) in all inertial reference frames and do not have
length contraction effect.

Cool Stars in Hot Places,"S. T. Megeath (University of Toledo), E. Gaidos (University of
  Hawaii), J. J. Hester (Arizona State University), F. C. Adams (University of
  Michigan), J. Bally (University of Colorado), J.-E. Lee (University of
  California Los Angeles), S. Wolk (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
  Astrophysics)","  During the last three decades, evidence has mounted that star and planet
formation is not an isolated process, but is influenced by current and previous
generations of stars. Although cool stars form in a range of environments, from
isolated globules to rich embedded clusters, the influences of other stars on
cool star and planet formation may be most significant in embedded clusters,
where hundreds to thousands of cool stars form in close proximity to OB stars.
At the cool stars 14 meeting, a splinter session was convened to discuss the
role of environment in the formation of cool stars and planetary systems; with
an emphasis on the ``hot'' environment found in rich clusters. We review here
the basic results, ideas and questions presented at the session. We have
organized this contribution into five basic questions: what is the typical
environment of cool star formation, what role do hot star play in cool star
formation, what role does environment play in planet formation, what is the
role of hot star winds and supernovae, and what was the formation environment
of the Sun? The intention is to review progress made in addressing each
question, and to underscore areas of agreement and contention.

Heights and metrics with logarithmic singularities,Gerard Freixas i Montplet,"  We prove lower bound and finiteness properties for arakelovian heights with
respect to pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles. These heights were
introduced by Burgos, Kramer and K\""uhn, in their extension of the arithmetic
intersection theory of Gillet and Soul\'e, aimed to deal with hermitian vector
bundles equipped with metrics admitting suitable logarithmic singularities. Our
results generalize the corresponding properties for the heights of
Bost-Gillet-Soul\'e, as well as the properties established by Faltings for
heights of points attached to hermitian line bundles whose metrics have
logarithmic singularities. We also discuss various geometric constructions
where such pre-log-log hermitian ample line bundles naturally arise.

"Bar-Halo Friction in Galaxies III: Particle Number Requirements for
  Simulations",J. A. Sellwood (Rutgers University),"  The question whether the dark matter halo density in the centers of galaxies
could be changed through interactions with a rotating bar in the baryonic disk
is of considerable current interest. While N-body simulations have been used to
address this question, it has also been claimed that results from such
simulations cannot be trusted. Based on a perturbative treatment of resonant
exchanges between orbits and a rotating perturbation, Weinberg & Katz contend
that N-body simulations of this process will not reveal the continuum result
unless many more than the usual numbers of particles are employed. Here I
report a study designed to examine their contention, finding results that show
no dependence on the number of particles over the range usually employed up to
that advocated by these authors. I show that my results are independent of all
numerical parameters, and that field methods perform equally with grid methods
in this respect. I also identify the reasons that the required particle number
suggested by Weinberg & Katz is excessive.

found that the renormalization of the quasiparticle (QP) dispersion changes
dramatically upon a rotation from GM to GK. The comparison of the experimental
data to the calculated band structure reveals that the QP-renormalization is
most pronounced along the GK-direction, while it is significantly weaker along
the GM-direction. We discuss the observed anisotropy in terms of multiorbital
effects and point out the relevance of magnetic correlations for the band
structure of Na0.73CoO2.

Charmless Three-body Decays of B Mesons,"Hai-Yang Cheng, Chun-Khiang Chua, Amarjit Soni","  Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the
factorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\to
P_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in
the exponential form $e^{-\alpha_{NR}} p_B\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT
results are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\to 0$. In addition, we
have identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix
elements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\bar K|\bar ss|0>$, which can be
constrained from the decay $\bar B^0\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\to K^-K_SK_S$. The
intermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through
the vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated
with the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the
Breit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated
by the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of
$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the
data within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\to K^+K^-K_{S}$
decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective
$\sin 2\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct
CP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the
latter. (iii) For $B\to K\pi\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant
contributions in $K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\bar K^0\pi^+\pi^-$ modes, in agreement
with the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.

"Electrical transport properties of polar heterointerface between KTaO3
  and SrTiO3","A. Kalabukhov, R. Gunnarsson, T. Claeson and D. Winkler","  Electrical transport of a polar heterointerface between two insulating
perovskites, KTaO3 and SrTiO3, is studied. It is formed between a thin KTaO3
film deposited on a top of TiO2- terminated (100) SrTiO3 substrate. The
resulting (KO)1-(TiO2)0 heterointerface is expected to be hole-doped according
to formal valences of K (1+) and Ti (4+). We observed electrical conductivity
and mobility in the KTaO3/SrTiO3 similar to values measured earlier in
electron-doped LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces. However, the sign of the charge
carriers in KTaO3/SrTiO3 obtained from the Hall measurements is negative. The
result is an important clue to the true origin of the doping at perovskite
oxide hetero-interfaces.

The Angular Separation of the Components of the Cepheid AW Per,D. Massa and N. R. Evans,"  The 6.4 day classical Cepheid AW Per is a spectroscopic binary with a period
of 40 years. Analyzing the centroids of HST/STIS spectra obtained in November
2001, we have determined the angular separation of the binary system. Although
we currently have spatially resolved data for a single epoch in the orbit, the
success of our approach opens the possibility of determining the inclination,
sini, for the system if the measurements are repeated at additional epochs.
Since the system is potentially a double lined spectroscopic binary, the
combination of spectroscopic orbits for both components and the visual orbit
would give the distance to the system and the masses of its components, thereby
providing a direct measurement of a Cepheid mass.

Transverse field effect in graphene ribbons,D. S. Novikov,"  It is shown that a graphene ribbon, a ballistic strip of carbon monolayer,
may serve as a quantum wire whose electronic properties can be continuously and
reversibly controlled by an externally applied transverse voltage. The electron
bands of armchair-edge ribbons undergo dramatic transformations: The Fermi
surface fractures, Fermi velocity and effective mass change sign, and
excitation gaps are reduced by the transverse field. These effects are manifest
in the conductance plateaus, van Hove singularities, thermopower, and activated
transport. The control over one-dimensional bands may help enhance effects of
electron correlations, and be utilized in device applications.

Domain Switching Kinetics in Disordered Ferroelectric Thin Films,"J. Y. Jo, H. S. Han, J.-G. Yoon, T. K. Song, S.-H. Kim, and T. W. Noh","  We investigated domain kinetics by measuring the polarization switching
behaviors of polycrystalline Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_{3}$ films, which are widely used in
ferroelectric memory devices. Their switching behaviors at various electric
fields and temperatures could be explained by assuming the Lorentzian
distribution of domain switching times. We viewed the switching process under
an electric field as a motion of the ferroelectric domain through a random
medium, and we showed that the local field variation due to dipole defects at
domain pinning sites could explain the intriguing distribution.

"Geometry of Time, Axiom of Choice and Neuro-Biological Quantum Zeno
  Effect",Moninder Singh Modgil,"  Role of axiom of choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by suggesting
that the conscious observer chooses the outcome from a mixed state. Further, in
a periodically repeating universe, these outcomes must be pre-recorded within
the non-physical conscious observers, which precludes free will. Free will
however exists in a universe with open time, It is suggested that psychology's
binding problem is connected with Cantor's original definition of set.
Influence of consciousness on material outcome through quantum processes is
discussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted
that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at
sufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so
called quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics.
Existence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in brain is predicted as a
space-time structural interface between consciousness and brain, whose
vaporization explains mass-loss reported in weighing experiments, conducting
during the moments of death.

"Probing the Structure of Gamma-Ray Burst Jets with Steep Decay Phase of
  their Early X-ray Afterglows","Kentaro Takami (1), Ryo Yamazaki (1), Takanori Sakamoto (2), Goro Sato
  (2) ((1) Hiroshima Univ., (2) NASA/GSFC)","  We show that the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be investigated
with the tail emission of the prompt GRB. The tail emission which we consider
is identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed
by the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive,
for the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail
emission for various jet models. The new definitions of the zero of time and
the time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions for
fitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which
is useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB
jet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay
index of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be
seen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay
index distribution tells us the information on the jet structure. Especially,
if we observe events whose decay index is less than about 2, both the uniform
and the Gaussian jet models will be disfavored according to our simulation
study.

incompatible with the usual string fragmentation scenario for particle
production.

"Excitation Spectrum Gap and Spin-Wave Stiffness of XXZ Heisenberg
  Chains: Global Renormalization-Group Calculation","Ozan S. Sariyer, A. Nihat Berker, and Michael Hinczewski","  The anisotropic XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain is studied using
renormalization-group theory. The specific heats and nearest-neighbor spin-spin
correlations are calculated thoughout the entire temperature and anisotropy
ranges in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions, obtaining a global
description and quantitative results. We obtain, for all anisotropies, the
antiferromagnetic spin-liquid spin-wave velocity and the Isinglike
ferromagnetic excitation spectrum gap, exhibiting the spin-wave to spinon
crossover. A number of characteristics of purely quantum nature are found: The
in-plane interaction s_i^x s_j^x + s_i^y s_j^y induces an antiferromagnetic
correlation in the out-of-plane s_i^z component, at higher temperatures in the
antiferromagnetic XXZ chain, dominantly at low temperatures in the
ferromagnetic XXZ chain, and, in-between, at all temperatures in the XY chain.
We find that the converse effect also occurs in the antiferromagnetic XXZ
chain: an antiferromagnetic s_i^z s_j^z interaction induces a correlation in
the s_i^xy component. As another purely quantum effect, (i) in the
antiferromagnet, the value of the specific heat peak is insensitive to
anisotropy and the temperature of the specific heat peak decreases from the
isotropic (Heisenberg) with introduction of either type (Ising or XY)
anisotropy; (ii) in complete contrast, in the ferromagnet, the value and
temperature of the specific heat peak increase with either type of anisotropy.

Precise Control of Band Filling in NaxCoO2,"Daisuke Yoshizumi, Yuji Muraoka, Yoshihiko Okamoto, Yoko Kiuchi,

susceptibility and specific heat measurements are carried out on a series of
high-quality polycrystalline samples prepared at 200 C with Na content in a
wide range of 0.35 =< x =< 0.70. It is found that dramatic changes in
electronic properties take place at a critical Na concentration x* that lies
between 0.58 and 0.59, which separates a Pauli paramagnetic and a Curie-Weiss
metals. It is suggested that at x* the Fermi level touches the bottom of the
a1g band at the gamma point, leading to a crucial change in the density of
states across x* and the emergence of a small electron pocket around the gamma
point for x > x*.
"
Observations on degenerate saddle point problems,Andrew V. Knyazev,"  We investigate degenerate saddle point problems, which can be viewed as limit
cases of standard mixed formulations of symmetric problems with large jumps in
coefficients. We prove that they are well-posed in a standard norm despite the
degeneracy. By wellposedness we mean a stable dependence of the solution on the
right-hand side. A known approach of splitting the saddle point problem into
separate equations for the primary unknown and for the Lagrange multiplier is
used. We revisit the traditional Ladygenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi (LBB) or
inf--sup condition as well as the standard coercivity condition, and analyze
how they are affected by the degeneracy of the corresponding bilinear forms. We
suggest and discuss generalized conditions that cover the degenerate case. The
LBB or inf--sup condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness of the
problem with respect to the Lagrange multiplier under some assumptions. The
generalized coercivity condition is necessary and sufficient for wellposedness
of the problem with respect to the primary unknown under some other
assumptions. We connect the generalized coercivity condition to the
positiveness of the minimum gap of relevant subspaces, and propose several
equivalent expressions for the minimum gap. Our results provide a foundation
for research on uniform wellposedness of mixed formulations of symmetric
problems with large jumps in coefficients in a standard norm, independent of
the jumps. Such problems appear, e.g., in numerical simulations of composite
materials made of components with contrasting properties.
"
Expected Planets in Globular Clusters,"Noam Soker and Alon Hershenhorn (Technion, Israel)","  We argue that all transient searches for planets in globular clusters have a
very low detection probability. Planets of low metallicity stars typically do
not reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system
properties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is
considered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,
respectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems
at high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,
where M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is
only at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it
is still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular
clusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at
orbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on
the role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in
globular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch
stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in
forming low mass white dwarfs.

Optical Zeno Gate: Bounds for Fault Tolerant Operation,Patrick M. Leung and Timothy C. Ralph,"  In principle the Zeno effect controlled-sign gate of Franson et al's (PRA 70,
062302, 2004) is a deterministic two-qubit optical gate. However, when
realistic values of photon loss are considered its fidelity is significantly
reduced. Here we consider the use of measurement based quantum processing
techniques to enhance the operation of the Zeno gate. With the help of quantum
teleportation, we show that it is possible to achieve a Zeno CNOT gate (GC-Zeno
gate) that gives (near) unit fidelity and moderate probability of success of
0.76 with a one-photon to two-photon transmission ratio $\kappa=10^4$. We
include some mode-mismatch effects and estimate the bounds on the mode overlap
and $\kappa$ for which fault tolerant operation would be possible.

"Differential Diversity Reception of MDPSK over Independent Rayleigh
  Channels with Nonidentical Branch Statistics and Asymmetric Fading Spectrum",Hua Fu and Pooi Yuen Kam,"  This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its
performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with
differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically
distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is
assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,
but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.
Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the
optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the
three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,
closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a
function of various system parameters.

Bulk viscosity of superfluid neutron stars,M. E. Gusakov (Ioffe Institute),"  The hydrodynamics, describing dynamical effects in superfluid neutron stars,
essentially differs from the standard one-fluid hydrodynamics. In particular,
we have four bulk viscosity coefficients in the theory instead of one. In this
paper we calculate these coefficients, for the first time, assuming they are
due to non-equilibrium beta-processes (such as modified or direct Urca
process). The results of our analysis are used to estimate characteristic
damping times of sound waves in superfluid neutron stars. It is demonstrated
that all four bulk viscosity coefficients lead to comparable dissipation of
sound waves and should be considered on the same footing.

  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is used to calculate the lowest order diagrams
in the two-body scatterings of ${\bar s}D$ and $D D$. With the use of coupling
constants determined from the meson sector, we find that ${\bar s}D$
interaction is attractive while $DD$ interaction is repulsive, and there is no
bound $\frac 12^+$ pentaquark state. A bound pentaquark $\Theta^+$ can only be
obtained with unphysically strong vector mesonic coupling constants.

restrictions on combinations of choices. We present models for frequency data
of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. When the restrictions on the combinations can be
described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a
Gr\""obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for
performing a Markov chain. We illustrate our setting with the National Center
Test for university entrance examinations in Japan. We also apply our method to
testing independence hypotheses involving genotypes at more than one locus or
haplotypes of alleles on the same chromosome.

New Terms for the Compact Form of Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian,"Hong-Hao Zhang, Wen-Bin Yan, J. K. Parry, Xue-Song Li","  The compact form of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian is a reformulation of
its original form and is expressed in terms of chiral rotated electroweak gauge
fields, which is crucial for relating the information of underlying theories to

form obtained in previous works is not complete. In this letter we add several
new chiral invariant terms to it and discuss the contributions of these terms
to the original electroweak chiral Lagrangian.

Seeing maximum entropy from the principle of virtual work,Qiuping A. Wang (ISMANS),"  We propose an extension of the principle of virtual work of mechanics to
random dynamics of mechanical systems. The total virtual work of the
interacting forces and inertial forces on every particle of the system is
calculated by considering the motion of each particle. Then according to the
principle of Lagrange-d'Alembert for dynamical equilibrium, the vanishing
ensemble average of the virtual work gives rise to the thermodynamic
equilibrium state with maximization of thermodynamic entropy. This approach
establishes a close relationship between the maximum entropy approach for
statistical mechanics and a fundamental principle of mechanics, and constitutes
an attempt to give the maximum entropy approach, considered by many as only an
inference principle based on the subjectivity of probability and entropy, the
status of fundamental physics law.

good properties with respect to nonlinear operations. In this spirit we give
several examples of propagation of singularities through nonlinear operators.

"Instanton Induced Neutrino Majorana Masses in CFT Orientifolds with
  MSSM-like spectra","L.E. Ibanez, A.N. Schellekens, A. M. Uranga","  Recently it has been shown that string instanton effects may give rise to
neutrino Majorana masses in certain classes of semi-realistic string
compactifications. In this paper we make a systematic search for supersymmetric
MSSM-like Type II Gepner orientifold constructions admitting boundary states
associated with instantons giving rise to neutrino Majorana masses and other L-
and/or B-violating operators. We analyze the zero mode structure of D-brane
instantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that only
instantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required to
contribute to the 4d superpotential. We however discuss how the addition of
fluxes and/or possible non-perturbative extensions of the orientifold
compactifications would allow also instantons with $Sp(2)$ and U(1) symmetries
to generate such superpotentials. In the context of Gepner orientifolds with
MSSM-like spectra, we find no models with O(1) instantons with just the
required zero modes to generate a neutrino mass superpotential. On the other
hand we find a number of models in one particular orientifold of the Gepner
model $(2,4,22,22)$ with $Sp(2)$ instantons with a few extra uncharged
non-chiral zero modes which could be easily lifted by the mentioned effects. A
few more orientifold examples are also found under less stringent constraints
on the zero modes. This class of $Sp(2)$ instantons have the interesting
property that R-parity conservation is automatic and the flavour structure of
the neutrino Majorana mass matrices has a simple factorized form.

two order parameters in a single phase is possible because the magnetic order
is linked to the formation of a spin density wave, and its order parameter is
not associated to a spectral gap but to an energy shift of the paramagnetic
bands. This peculiarity entails several distinct features in the phase diagram
and the spectral properties of the model, which may have been observed in
CeRhIn$_5$. Apart from the coexistence, we find an abrupt suppression of the
spin density wave when the superconducting and magnetic ordering temperatures
are equal. The divergence of the cyclotron mass extracted from de Haas-van
Alphen experiments is also analyzed in the same framework.

"B-pairs and (phi,Gamma)-modules",Laurent Berger,"  Main change from v1 : theorem C has been modified, see remark 3.1.7 (2).
  We study the category of B-pairs (W_e,W_dR^+) where W_e is a free
B_cris^{phi=1}-module with a semilinear and continuous action of G_K and where
W_dR^+ is a G_K-stable B_dR^+ -lattice in B_dR \otimes W_e. This category
contains the category of p-adic representations and is naturally equivalent to
the category of all (phi,Gamma)-modules over the Robba ring.

Vacuum Energy and Renormalization on the Edge,"M. Asorey, D. Garcia-Alvarez and J. M. Munoz-Castaneda","  The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is
analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective the
renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the
couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the
space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries this flow has a large
variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points
includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field
theories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed
points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are
conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions
are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary
conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes
we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the
renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy
evolution. On the contrary, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does
not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in
one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

Gauge Mediation in String Theory,"Teruhiko Kawano, Hirosi Ooguri, and Yutaka Ookouchi","  We show that a large class of phenomenologically viable models for gauge

Higher harmonics increase LISA's mass reach for supermassive black holes,"K.G. Arun, Bala R. Iyer, B. S. Sathyaprakash, Siddhartha Sinha","  Current expectations on the signal to noise ratios and masses of supermassive
black holes which the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can observe are
based on using in matched filtering only the dominant harmonic of the inspiral
waveform at twice the orbital frequency. Other harmonics will affect the
signal-to-noise ratio of systems currently believed to be observable by LISA.
More significantly, inclusion of other harmonics in our matched filters would
mean that more massive systems that were previously thought to be {\it not}
visible in LISA should be detectable with reasonable SNRs. Our estimates show
that we should be able to significantly increase the mass reach of LISA and
observe the more commonly occurring supermassive black holes of masses $\sim
10^8M_\odot.$ More specifically, with the inclusion of all known harmonics LISA
will be able to observe even supermassive black hole coalescences with total
mass $\sim 10^8 M_\odot (10^9M_\odot)$ (and mass-ratio 0.1) for a low frequency
cut-off of $10^{-4}{\rm Hz}$ $(10^{-5}{\rm Hz})$ with an SNR up to $\sim 60$
$(\sim 30)$ at a distance of 3 Gpc. This is important from the astrophysical
viewpoint since observational evidence for the existence of black holes in this
mass range is quite strong and binaries containing such supermassive black
holes will be inaccessible to LISA if one uses as detection templates only the
dominant harmonic.

"Extended Comment on ""One-Range Addition Theorems for Coulomb Interaction
  Potential and Its Derivatives"" by I. I. Guseinov (Chem. Phys. Vol. 309
  (2005), pp. 209 - 213)",Ernst Joachim Weniger,"  Addition theorems are principal tools that express a function $f (\bm{r} \pm
\bm{r}')$ in terms of products of other functions that only depend on either
$\bm{r}$ or $\bm{r}'$. The best known example of such an addition theorem is
the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic
two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

Representative Ensembles in Statistical Mechanics,V.I. Yukalov,"  The notion of representative statistical ensembles, correctly representing
statistical systems, is strictly formulated. This notion allows for a proper
description of statistical systems, avoiding inconsistencies in theory. As an
illustration, a Bose-condensed system is considered. It is shown that a
self-consistent treatment of the latter, using a representative ensemble,
always yields a conserving and gapless theory.

"On the weight structure of cyclic codes over $GF(q)$, $q>2$",I. Mullayeva,"  The interrelation between the cyclic structure of an ideal, i.e., a cyclic
code over Galois field $GF(q)$, $q>2$, and its classes of proportional elements
is considered. This relation is used in order to define the code's weight
structure. The equidistance conditions of irreducible nonprimitive codes over
GF(q) are given. Besides that, the minimum distance for some class of
nonprimitive cyclic codes is found.

Simplifying additivity problems using direct sum constructions,"Motohisa Fukuda, Michael M. Wolf","  We study the additivity problems for the classical capacity of quantum
channels, the minimal output entropy and its convex closure. We show for each
of them that additivity for arbitrary pairs of channels holds iff it holds for
arbitrary equal pairs, which in turn can be taken to be unital. In a similar
sense, weak additivity is shown to imply strong additivity for any convex
entanglement monotone. The implications are obtained by considering direct sums
of channels (or states) for which we show how to obtain several information
theoretic quantities from their values on the summands. This provides a simple
and general tool for lifting additivity results.

"Modulational instability in nonlocal Kerr-type media with random
  parameters",E.V. Doktorov and M.A. Molchan,"  Modulational instability of continuous waves in nonlocal focusing and
defocusing Kerr media with stochastically varying diffraction (dispersion) and
nonlinearity coefficients is studied both analytically and numerically. It is
shown that nonlocality with the sign-definite Fourier images of the medium
response functions suppresses considerably the growth rate peak and bandwidth
of instability caused by stochasticity. Contrary, nonlocality can enhance
modulational instability growth for a response function with negative-sign
bands.

"SUBARU HDS Observations of a Balmer-Dominated Shock in Tycho's Supernova
  Remnant","Jae-Joon Lee, Bon-Chul Koo, John Raymond, Parviz Ghavamian, Tae-Soo
  Pyo, Akito Ta jitsu, and Masahiko Hayashi","  We present an Ha spectral observation of a Balmer-dominated shock on the
eastern side of Tycho's supernova remnant using the Subaru Telescope. Utilizing
the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS), we measure the spatial variation of the
line profile between preshock and postshock gas. Our observation clearly shows
a broadening and centroid shift of the narrow-component postshock Ha line
relative to the Ha emission from the preshock gas. The observation supports the
existence of a thin precursor where gas is heated and accelerated ahead of the
shock. Furthermore, the spatial profile of the emission ahead of the Balmer
filament shows a gradual gradient in the Ha intensity and line width ahead of
the shock. We propose that this region (~10^16 cm) is likely to be the
spatially resolved precursor. The line width increases from ~30 up to ~45 km/s,
and its central velocity shows a redshift of ~5 km/s across the shock front.
The characteristics of the precursor are consistent with a cosmic-ray
precursor, although the possibility of a fast neutral precursor is not ruled
out.

"Orbits of tori extended by finite groups and their polynomial hulls: the
  case of connected complex orbits",V.M. Gichev,"  Let $V$ be a complex linear space, $G\subset\GL(V)$ be a compact group. We
consider the problem of description of polynomial hulls $\wh{Gv}$ for orbits
$Gv$, $v\in V$, assuming that the identity component of $G$ is a torus $T$. The
paper contains a universal construction for orbits which satisfy the inclusion
$Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ and a characterization of pairs $(G,V)$ such that it is
true for a generic $v\in V$. The hull of a finite union of $T$-orbits in
$T^\bbC v$ can be distinguished in $\clos T^\bbC v$ by a finite collection of
inequalities of the type $\abs{z_1}^{s_1}...\abs{z_n}^{s_n}\leq c$. In
particular, this is true for $Gv$. If powers in the monomials are independent
of $v$, $Gv\subset T^\bbC v$ for a generic $v$, and either the center of $G$ is
finite or $T^\bbC$ has an open orbit, then the space $V$ and the group $G$ are
products of standard ones; the latter means that $G=S_nT$, where $S_n$ is the
group of all permutations of coordinates and $T$ is either $\bbT^n$ or
$\SU(n)\cap\bbT^n$, where $\bbT^n$ is the torus of all diagonal matrices in
$\rU(n)$. The paper also contains a description of polynomial hulls for orbits
of isotropy groups of bounded symmetric domains. This result is already known,
but we formulate it in a different form and supply with a shorter proof.

"Formation of a sonic horizon in isotropically expanding Bose-Einstein
  condensates","Yasunari Kurita, Takao Morinari","  We propose a simple experiment to create a sonic horizon in isotropically
trapped cold atoms within currently available experimental techniques.
Numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation shows that the sonic
horizon should appear by making the condensate expand. The expansion is
triggered by changing the interaction which can be controlled by the Feshbach
resonance in real experiments. The sonic horizon is shown to be quasi-static
for sufficiently strong interaction or large number of atoms. The
characteristic temperature that is associated with particle emission from the
horizon, which corresponds to the Hawking temperature in an ideal situation, is
estimated to be a few nK.

"Zero-temperature resistive transition in Josephson-junction arrays at
  irrational frustration",Enzo Granato,"  We use a driven Monte Carlo dynamics in the phase representation to determine
the linear resistivity and current-voltage scaling of a two-dimensional
Josephson-junction array at an irrational flux quantum per plaquette. The
results are consistent with a phase-coherence transition scenario where the
critical temperature vanishes. The linear resistivity is nonzero at any finite
temperatures but nonlinear behavior sets in at a temperature-dependent
crossover current determined by the thermal critical exponent. From a dynamic
scaling analysis we determine this critical exponent and the thermally
activated behavior of the linear resistivity. The results are in agreement with
earlier calculations using the resistively shunted-junction model for the
dynamics of the array. The linear resistivity behavior is consistent with some
experimental results on arrays of superconducting grains but not on wire
networks, which we argue have been obtained in a current regime above the
crossover current.

Protostellar clusters in intermediate-mass (IM) star forming regions,"A. Fuente, C. Ceccarelli, R. Neri, T. Alonso-Albi, P. Caselli, D.
  Johnstone, E.F. van Dishoeck, F. Wyrowski","  The transition between the low density groups of T Tauri stars and the high
density clusters around massive stars occurs in the intermediate-mass (IM)
range (M$_*$$\sim$2--8 M$_\odot$). High spatial resolution studies of IM young
stellar objects (YSO) can provide important clues to understand the clustering
in massive star forming regions.
  Aims: Our aim is to search for clustering in IM Class 0 protostars. The high
spatial resolution and sensitivity provided by the new A configuration of the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) allow us to study the clustering in these
nearby objects.
  Methods: We have imaged three IM Class 0 protostars (Serpens-FIRS 1, IC 1396
N, CB 3) in the continuum at 3.3 and 1.3mm using the PdBI. The sources have
been selected with different luminosity to investigate the dependence of the
clustering process on the luminosity of the source.
  Results: Only one millimeter (mm) source is detected towards the low
luminosity source Serpens--FIRS 1. Towards CB 3 and IC1396 N, we detect two
compact sources separated by $\sim$0.05 pc. The 1.3mm image of IC 1396 N, which
provides the highest spatial resolution, reveal that one of these cores is
splitted in, at least, three individual sources.

The Epps effect revisited,"Bence Toth, Janos Kertesz","  We analyse the dependence of stock return cross-correlations on the sampling
frequency of the data known as the Epps effect: For high resolution data the
cross-correlations are significantly smaller than their asymptotic value as
observed on daily data. The former description implies that changing trading
frequency should alter the characteristic time of the phenomenon. This is not
true for the empirical data: The Epps curves do not scale with market activity.
The latter result indicates that the time scale of the phenomenon is connected
to the reaction time of market participants (this we denote as human time
scale), independent of market activity. In this paper we give a new description
of the Epps effect through the decomposition of cross-correlations. After
testing our method on a model of generated random walk price changes we justify
our analytical results by fitting the Epps curves of real world data.

Transitive powers of Young-Jucys-Murphy elements are central,I. P. Goulden and D. M. Jackson,"  Although powers of the Young-Jucys-Murphya elements X_i = (1 i) + ... +(i-1
i), i = 1, ..., n, in the symmetric group S_n acting on {1, ...,n} do not lie
in the centre of the group algebra of S_n, we show that transitive powers,
namely the sum of the contributions from elements that act transitively on {1,
>...,n}, are central. We determine the coefficients, which we call star
factorization numbers, that occur in the resolution of transitive powers with
respect to the class basis of the centre of S_n, and show that they have a
polynomiality property. These centrality and polynomiality properties have
seemingly unrelated consequences. First, they answer a question raised by Pak
about reduced decompositions; second, they explain and extend the beautiful
symmetry result discovered by Irving and Rattan; and thirdly, we relate the
polynomiality to an existing polynomiality result for a class of double Hurwitz
numbers associated with branched covers of the sphere, which therefore suggests
that there may be an ELSV-type formula associated with the star factorization
numbers.

group (acting on variables). We use these results to derive the Frobenius
series for the enveloping algebra of the derived free Lie algebra in n
variables.

"Spin Dynamics Of $qqq$ Wave Function On Light Front In High Momentum
  Limit Of QCD : Role Of $qqq$ Force",A.N. Mitra,"  The contribution of a spin-rich $qqq$ force (in conjunction with pairwise
$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked
out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be
ignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of
this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)
formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality
Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a
spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially
crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'
of the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.

This term is shown to be regularization dependent but nevertheless it can be
found unambiguously in different regularization schemes at zero and finite
temperature.

Neutrino Astronomy with High Spatial Resolution is Already Existing,Valentin. A. Rantsev-Kartinov,"  By basing on observations of skeletal structures of the Sun and assuming that
some of them are located inside of star, and also that a filamentary (linear)
matter (whose a model earlier was put forward by B.U. Rodionov) is in basis of
these internal structures the author consider possible processes of images
formation of these structures inside the Sun and theirs coming out into space
and also gives an elementary estimations of its parameters, which allow: i) to
form their images in a flux of electronic neutrinos; ii) to carry out these
images from within of the Sun into space; iii) to develop these images in form
of a concomitant flux of soft x-ray, which next is recorded by telescope of
soft x-ray. It is supposed the processes considered here, actually, can be
accepted as future base of neutrino astronomy with high spatial resolution.

The dependence of the estimated luminosities of ULX on spectral models,"A. Senorita Devi (Manipur Univ), R. Misra (IUCAA), V. K. Agrawal
  (TIFR), K. Y. Singh (Manipur Univ)","  Data from {\it Chandra} observations of thirty nearby galaxies were analyzed
and 365 X-ray point sources were chosen whose spectra were not contaminated by
excessive diffuse emission and not affected by photon pile up. The spectra of
these sources were fitted using two spectral models (an absorbed power-law and
a disk blackbody) to ascertain the dependence of estimated parameters on the
spectral model used. It was found that the cumulative luminosity function
depends on the choice of the spectral model, especially for luminosities $>
10^{40}$ ergs/s. In accordance with previous results, a large number ($\sim
80$) of the sources have luminosities $> 10^{39}$ ergs/s (Ultra-Luminous X-ray
sources) with indistinguishable average spectral parameters (inner disk
temperature $\sim 1$ keV and/or photon index $\Gamma \sim 2$) with those of the
lower luminosities ones. After considering foreground stars and known
background AGN,we identify four sources whose minimum luminosity exceed
$10^{40}$ ergs/s, and call them Extremely Luminous X-ray sources (ELX). The
spectra of these sources are in general better represented by the disk black
body model than the power-law one. These ELX can be grouped into two distinct
spectral classes. Two of them have an inner disk temperature of $< 0.5$ keV and
hence are called ``supersoft'' ELX, while the other two have temperatures
$\gtrsim 1.3$ keV and are called ``hard'' ELX. The estimated inner disk
temperatures of the supersoft ELX are compatible with the hypothesis that they
harbor intermediate size black holes, which are accreting at $\sim 0.5$ times
their Eddington Luminosity. The radiative mechanism for hard ELX, seems to be
Inverse Comptonization, which in contrast to standard black holes systems, is
probably saturated.

"Evidence for Symplectic Symmetry in Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model
  Results for Light Nuclei","Tomas Dytrych, Kristina D. Sviratcheva, Chairul Bahri, Jerry P.
  Draayer, James P. Vary","  Clear evidence for symplectic symmetry in low-lying states of $^{12}$C and
$^{16}$O is reported. Eigenstates of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, determined within
the framework of the no-core shell model using the JISP16 $NN$ realistic
interaction, typically project at the 85-90% level onto a few of the most
deformed symplectic basis states that span only a small fraction of the full
model space. The results are nearly independent of whether the bare or
renormalized effective interactions are used in the analysis. The outcome
confirms Elliott's \SU{3} model which underpins the symplectic scheme, and
above all, points to the relevance of a symplectic no-core shell model that can
reproduce experimental B(E2) values without effective charges as well as
deformed spatial modes associated with clustering phenomena in nuclei.

find that the spinning string spacetime is deformed in such a way to allow the
existence of closed timelike geodesics.

On spherically symmetrical accretion in fractal media,Nirupam Roy,"  We use fractional integrals to generalize the description of hydrodynamic
accretion in fractal media. The fractional continuous medium model allows the
generalization of the equations of balance of mass density and momentum
density. These make it possible to consider the general case of spherical
hydrodynamic accretion onto a gravitating mass embedded in a fractal medium.
The general nature of the solution is similar to the ""Bondi solution"", but the
accretion rate may vary substantially and the dependence on central mass may
change significantly depending on dimensionality of the fractal medium. The
theory shows consistency with the observational data and numerical simulation
results for the particular case of accretion onto pre-main-sequence stars.

QCD in One Dimension at Nonzero Chemical Potential,L. Ravagli and J.J.M. Verbaarschot,"  Using an integration formula recently derived by Conrey, Farmer and
Zirnbauer, we calculate the expectation value of the phase factor of the
fermion determinant for the staggered lattice QCD action in one dimension. We
show that the chemical potential can be absorbed into the quark masses; the
theory is in the same chiral symmetry class as QCD in three dimensions at zero
chemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed number
of lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results are
in agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrix
theory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensate
is due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered for
QCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperature
on the average phase factor is discussed in a schematic random matrix model.

  Crowther, A. Herrero, N. Langer, D. J. Lennon, F. Najarro, M. R. Villamariz,
  J. S. Vink","  [Abridged] We have studied the optical spectra of 28 O- and early B-type
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young
star-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the
genetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and
LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation
scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample
contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be
~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs
and giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating
evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be
intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and
comparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good
agreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <

Identification of Absorption Features in an Extrasolar Planet Atmosphere,T. S. Barman,"  Water absorption is identified in the atmosphere of HD209458b by comparing
models for the planet's transmitted spectrum to recent, multi-wavelength,

(2007). A cloud-free model which includes solar abundances, rainout of
condensates, and photoionization of sodium and potassium is in good agreement
with the entire set of eclipse-depth measurements from the ultraviolet to
near-infrared. Constraints are placed on condensate removal by gravitational
settling, the bulk metallicity, and the redistribution of absorbed stellar
flux. Comparisons are also made to the Charbonneau et al. (2002) sodium

Strange Nucleon Form Factors from $ep$ and $\nu p$ Elastic Scattering,Stephen Pate,"  The recent parity-violating $ep$ forward-scattering elastic asymmetry data
from Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\nu p$ elastic
cross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the
strangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for
momentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results,
combined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at
$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms
of $uuds\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop
configurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New
experiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the
$\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of
$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\nu p$
elastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness
contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)
are to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of
the nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed
before the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.

values in the range ~400-1500 km s-1 and velocity shifts V~120-600 km s-1.
  We present an infall model which can explain successfully most Ly-alpha
morphological and spectroscopic properties of the nebula associated with MRC
1558-003. This adds further support to our previous conclusion that the
_quiescent_ giant nebulae associated with this and other high redshift powerful
radio galaxies are in infall. A problem for this model is the difficulty to
reproduce the large Ly-alpha FWHM values.
  We have discovered a giant (~85 kpc) Ly-alpha nebula associated with the
radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at z=2.64. It shows strikingly relaxed kinematics
(FWHM< 300 km s-1 and V<120 km s-1), unique among high z (>2) radio galaxies.

"Condensation of Vortex-Strings: Effective Potential Contribution Through
  Dual Actions","Rudnei O. Ramos, J. F. Medeiros Neto, Daniel G. Barci and Cesar A.
  Linhares","  Topological excitations are believed to play an important role in different
areas of physics. For example, one case of topical interest is the use of dual
models of quantum cromodynamics to understand properties of its vacuum and
confinement through the condensation of magnetic monopoles and vortices. Other
applications are related to the role of these topological excitations,
nonhomogeneous solutions of the field equations, in phase transitions
associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories, whose study is
of importance in phase transitions in the early universe, for instance. Here we
show a derivation of a model dual to the scalar Abelian Higgs model where its
topological excitations, namely vortex-strings, become manifest and can be
treated in a quantum field theory way. The derivation of the nontrivial
contribution of these vacuum excitations to phase transitions and its analogy
with superconductivity is then made possible and they are studied here.

"Observation of Anti-correlation between Scintillation and Ionization for
  MeV Gamma-Rays in Liquid Xenon","E. Aprile, K.L. Giboni, P. Majewski, K. Ni, M. Yamashita","  A strong anti-correlation between ionization and scintillation signals
produced by MeV gamma-rays in liquid xenon has been measured and used to
improve the energy resolution by combining the two signals. The improvement is
explained by reduced electron-ion recombination fluctuations of the combined
signal compared to fluctuations of the individual signals. Simultaneous
measurements of ionization and scintillation signals were carried out with
Cs-137, Na-22 and Co-60 gamma rays, as a function of electric field in the
liquid. A resolution of 1.7%(sigma) at 662 keV was measured at 1 kV/cm,
significantly better than the resolution from either scintillation or
ionization alone. A detailed analysis indicates that further improvement to
less than 1%(sigma) is possible with higher light collection efficiency and
lower electronic noise.

Massive Stars: From the VLT to the ELT,C. J. Evans,"  New facilities and technologies have advanced our understanding of massive
stars significantly over the past 30 years. Here I introduce a new large survey
of massive stars using VLT-FLAMES, noting the target fields and observed binary
fractions. These data have been used for the first empirical test of the
metallicity dependence of the intensity of stellar winds, finding good
agreement with theory -- an important result for the evolutionary models that
are used to interpret distant clusters, starbursts, and star-forming galaxies.
Looking ahead, plans for future Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) are now
undergoing significant development, and offer the exciting prospect of
observing spatially-resolved massive stars well beyond the Local Group.

"""Illusion of control"" in Minority and Parrondo Games",J.B. Satinover and D. Sornette,"  Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This
ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of
when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability
to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.

Classification of Noncommuting Quadrilaterals of Factors,Pinhas Grossman and Masaki Izumi,"  A quadrilateral of factors is an irreducible inclusion of factors $N \subset
M$ with intermediate subfactors $P$ and $Q$ such that $P$ and $Q$ generate $M$
and the intersection of $P$ and $Q$ is $N$. We investigate the structure of a
non-commuting quadrilateral of factors with all the elementary inclusions
$P\subset M$, $Q\subset M$, $N\subset P$, and $N\subset Q$ 2-supertransitive.
In particular we classify such quadrilaterals with the indices of the
elementary subfactors less than or equal to 4. We also compute the angles
between $P$ and $Q$ for quadrilaterals coming from $\alpha$-induction and
asymptotic inclusions.

"Investigation of Energy Spectrum of EGRET Gamma-ray Sources by an
  Extensive Air Shower Experiment","M. Khakian Ghomi, M. Bahmanabadi, F. Sheidaei, J. Samimi, A. Anvari","  Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) ($E>100 $TeV) Extensive Air Showers (EASs) have been
monitored for a period of five years (1997-2003), using a small array of
scintillation detectors in Tehran, Iran. The data have been analyzed to take in
to account of the dependence of source counts on zenith angle. Because of
varying thickness of the overlaying atmosphere, the shower count rate is
extremely dependent on zenith angle. During a calendar year different sources
come in the field of view of the array at varying zenith angles and have
different effective observation time equivalent to zenith in a day. High energy
gamma-ray sources from the EGRET third catalogue where observed and the data
were analyzed using an excess method. Upper limits were obtained for 10 EGRET
sources. Then we investigated the EAS event rates for these 10 sources and
obtained a flux for each of them using parameters of our experiment results and
simulations. Finally we investigated the gamma-ray spectrum in the UHE range
using these fluxes with reported fluxes of the EGRET sources.

"Conjugate field and fluctuation-dissipation relation for the dynamic
  phase transition in the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model","D. T. Robb, P. A. Rikvold, A. Berger, and M. A. Novotny","  The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillating
applied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,
second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is the
period-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls in
the same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the
two-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first
time the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,
period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a
square-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,
\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for
the critical isotherm, \delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies
that H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size
scaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period
provides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,
for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a
fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature
T_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and
field amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b. This FDR justifies the use
of the scaled variance of Q as a proxy for the nonequilibrium susceptibility,
\partial<Q> / \partial H_b, in the critical region.

"High Galactic Latitude Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen Structure and
  Associated (WMAP) High Frequency Continuum Emission",Gerrit L. Verschuur,"  Spatial associations have been found between interstellar neutral hydrogen
(HI) emission morphology and small-scale structure observed by the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) in an area bounded by l = 60 & 180 deg, b =
30 & 70 deg, which was the primary target for this study. This area is marked
by the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance of
intermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightest
peaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area is
examined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated that
the associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Close
examination of several of the associations reveals important new properties of
diffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocity
cloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of soft
X-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It is
suggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emission
observed by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting one
another, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions of
enhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possible
that dust grains play a role in producing the emission. However, the primary
purpose of this report is to draw attention to these apparent associations
without offering an unambiguous explanation as to the relevant emission
mechanism(s).

"Negative- and positive-phase-velocity propagation in an isotropic chiral
  medium moving at constant velocity","Tom G.Mackay (University of Edinburgh), Akhlesh Lakhtakia
  (Pennsylvania State University)","  Analysis of electromagnetic planewave propagation in a medium which is a
spatiotemporally homogeneous, temporally nonlocal, isotropic, chiral medium in
a co-moving frame of reference shows that the medium is both spatially and
temporally nonlocal with respect to all non-co-moving inertial frames of
reference. Using the Lorentz transformations of electric and magnetic fields,
we show that plane waves which have positive phase velocity in the co-moving
frame of reference can have negative phase velocity in certain non-co-moving
frames of reference. Similarly, plane waves which have negative phase velocity
in the co-moving frame can have positive phase velocity in certain
non-co-moving frames.

"Sensitivity of solar off-limb line profiles to electron density
  stratification and the velocity distribution anisotropy",N.-E. Raouafi and S. K. Solanki,"  The effect of the electron density stratification on the intensity profiles
of the H I Ly-$\alpha$ line and the O VI and Mg X doublets formed in solar
coronal holes is investigated. We employ an analytical 2-D model of the large
scale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the corona
at the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation to
determine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solar
corona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). The
main assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of the
coronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsun
from the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X are
sensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.
However, Ly-$\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. The
calculated total intensities of Ly-$\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to a
lesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observed
ones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observed
profiles of Ly-$\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the considered
electron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only few
stratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO data
result in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively close
to the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributions
are employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other considered
observables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of the
velocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut as
previous investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...

Subfactors and Hadamard Matrices,Wes Camp and Remus Nicoara,"  To any complex Hadamard matrix H one associates a spin model commuting
square, and therefore a hyperfinite subfactor. The standard invariant of this
subfactor captures certain ""group-like"" symmetries of H. To gain some insight,
we compute the first few relative commutants of such subfactors for Hadamard
matrices of small dimensions. Also, we show that subfactors arising from Dita
type matrices have intermediate subfactors, and thus their standard invariants
have some extra structure besides the Jones projections.

  Schwarz, W. Skidmore, A. Staude, M. A. P. Torres","  [Abridged] We present time-series optical photometry of five new CVs
identified by the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The eclipses observed in HS 0129+2933,
HS 0220+0603, and HS 0455+8315 provided very accurate orbital periods of
3.35129827(65), 3.58098501(34), and 3.56937674(26) h, respectively. HS
0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)
h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS
0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbital
period of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observed
photometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopic
behaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These new
additions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per cent
of the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating the
requirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and the
models based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,
the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becoming
more pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h period
interval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed by
our results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of the
Hamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbital
periods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems close
to the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with the
standard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have the
highest mass transfer rates among CVs. Finally, we review the full range of
common properties that the SW Sex stars exhibit.

Finding (or not) New Gamma-ray Pulsars with GLAST,Scott M. Ransom (NRAO),"  Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources
observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio
pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray
observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for
the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens
to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this
range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a
pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be
conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and
statistics scale with various parameters.

Did time begin? Will time end?,Paul H. Frampton,"  Did time begin at a Big Bang? Will the present expansion of the universe last
for a finite or infinite time? These questions sound philosophical but are
becoming, now in the twenty-first century, central to the scientific study of
cosmology. The answers, which should become clarified in the next decade or
two, could have profound implications for how we see our own role in the
universe. Since the original publication of Stephen Hawking's {\it A Brief
History of Time} in 1988, the answers to these questions have progressed as a
result of research by the community of active theoretical physicists including
myself. To present the underlying ideas requires discussion of a wide range of
topics in cosmology, especially the make up of the energy content of the
universe. A brief summary of my conclusions, that of three different
possibilities concerning the history and future of time, the least likely is
the conventional wisdom (time began and will never end) and most likely is a
cyclic model (time never begins or ends), is in the short final Chapter which
could be read first. To understand the reasoning leading to my conclusions
could encourage reading of my entire book. My hope in writing this, my first
popular book, is that it will engender reflection about time. Many a
non-scientist may already hold a philosophical opinion about whether time
begins and ends. This book's aim is to present some recently discovered
scientific facts which can focus the reader's consideration of the two short
questions in my title.

"Experimental and theoretical study of light scattering by individual
  mature red blood cells by use of scanning flow cytometry and discrete dipole
  approximation","Maxim A. Yurkin, Konstantin A. Semyanov, Peter A. Tarasov, Andrei V.
  Chernyshev, Alfons G. Hoekstra, and Valeri P. Maltsev","  Elastic light scattering by mature red blood cells (RBCs) was theoretically
and experimentally analyzed with the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and
the scanning flow cytometry (SFC), respectively. SFC permits measurement of
angular dependence of light-scattering intensity (indicatrix) of single
particles. A mature RBC is modeled as a biconcave disk in DDA simulations of
light scattering. We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to the
direction of the incident light upon the indicatrix. Numerical calculations of
indicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried
out. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC
showed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We
simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for
RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk,
the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two
orientations, i.e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model
for rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk
model.

"Inflation, bifurcations of nonlinear curvature Lagrangians and dark
  energy","Eckehard W. Mielke, Fjodor V. Kusmartsev, Franz E. Schunck","  A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified
gravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective
Lagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into
several almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective
gravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in
the bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different
Einsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new
light on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but
also on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and
inflation.

Stability of Chaplygin gas thin-shell wormholes,"Ernesto F. Eiroa, Claudio Simeone","  In this paper we construct spherical thin-shell wormholes supported by a

Reissner-Nordstrom metrics. In the last two cases, we find that there are
values of the parameters for which stable static solutions exist.

"Lattice refining loop quantum cosmology, anisotropic models and
  stability","Martin Bojowald, Daniel Cartin and Gaurav Khanna","  A general class of loop quantizations for anisotropic models is introduced
and discussed, which enhances loop quantum cosmology by relevant features seen
in inhomogeneous situations. The main new effect is an underlying lattice which
is being refined during dynamical changes of the volume. In general, this leads
to a new feature of dynamical difference equations which may not have constant
step-size, posing new mathematical problems. It is discussed how such models
can be evaluated and what lattice refinements imply for semiclassical behavior.
Two detailed examples illustrate that stability conditions can put strong
constraints on suitable refinement models, even in the absence of a fundamental
Hamiltonian which defines changes of the underlying lattice. Thus, a large
class of consistency tests of loop quantum gravity becomes available. In this
context, it will also be seen that quantum corrections due to inverse powers of
metric components in a constraint are much larger than they appeared recently
in more special treatments of isotropic, free scalar models where they were
artificially suppressed.

Testing Disk Instability Models for Giant Planet Formation,Alan P. Boss,"  Disk instability is an attractive yet controversial means for the rapid
formation of giant planets in our solar system and elsewhere. Recent concerns
regarding the first adiabatic exponent of molecular hydrogen gas are addressed
and shown not to lead to spurious clump formation in the author's disk
instability models. A number of disk instability models have been calculated in
order to further test the robustness of the mechanism, exploring the effects of
changing the pressure equation of state, the vertical temperature profile, and
other parameters affecting the temperature distribution. Possible reasons for
differences in results obtained by other workers are discussed. Disk
instability remains as a plausible formation mechanism for giant planets.

High-dimensional variable selection,"Larry Wasserman, Kathryn Roeder","  This paper explores the following question: what kind of statistical
guarantees can be given when doing variable selection in high-dimensional

second stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use
hypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two
stages as ""screening"" and the last stage as ""cleaning."" We consider three
screening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise
regression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain
conditions.

Depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod--hard sphere mixtures,"Yuri Martinez-Raton, Giorgio Cinacchi, Enrique Velasco, Luis Mederos","  It is known that when hard spheres are added to a pure system of hard rods
the stability of the smectic phase may be greatly enhanced, and that this
effect can be rationalised in terms of depletion forces. In the present paper
we first study the effect of orientational order on depletion forces in this
particular binary system, comparing our results with those obtained adopting
the usual approximation of considering the rods parallel and their orientations
frozen. We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheres
of different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our results
indicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decrease
significantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase when
compared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientation
approximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\tau$ parameter,
which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. We
present closed expressions for $\tau$, and show that it is intimately connected
with the depletion potential. We then analyse the effect of particle geometry
by comparing results pertaining to systems of parallel rods of different shapes
(spherocylinders, cylinders and parallelepipeds). We finally provide results
based on the Zwanzig approximation of a Fundamental--Measure
density--functional theory applied to mixtures of parallelepipeds and cubes of
different sizes. In this case, we show that the $\tau$ parameter exhibits a
linear asymptotic behaviour in the limit of large values of the hard--rod
aspect ratio, in conformity with Onsager theory, as well as in the limit of
large values of the ratio of rod breadth to cube side length, $d$, in contrast
to Onsager approximation, which predicts $\tau\sim d^3$.

demonstrating a systematic chemical differentiation across the sample, which we

Challenges for MSSM Higgs searches at Hadron Colliders,"M. Carena, A. Menon and C.E.M. Wagner","  In this article we analyze the impact of B-physics and Higgs physics at LEP
on standard and non-standard Higgs bosons searches at the Tevatron and the LHC,
within the framework of minimal flavor violating supersymmetric models. The
B-physics constraints we consider come from the experimental measurements of
the rare B-decays b -> s gamma and B_u -> tau nu and the experimental limit on
the B_s -> mu+ mu- branching ratio. We show that these constraints are severe
for large values of the trilinear soft breaking parameter A_t, rendering the
non-standard Higgs searches at hadron colliders less promising. On the contrary
these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the
Higgsino mass parameter mu, enhancing the prospects for the direct detection of
non-standard Higgs bosons at both colliders. We also consider the available
ATLAS and CMS projected sensitivities in the standard model Higgs search
channels, and we discuss the LHC's ability in probing the whole MSSM parameter
space. In addition we also consider the expected Tevatron collider
sensitivities in the standard model Higgs h -> b bbar channel to show that it
may be able to find 3 sigma evidence in the B-physics allowed regions for small
or moderate values of the stop mixing parameter.

Optimization in Gradient Networks,Natali Gulbahce,"  Gradient networks can be used to model the dominant structure of complex
networks. Previous works have focused on random gradient networks. Here we
study gradient networks that minimize jamming on substrate networks with
scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structure. We introduce structural
correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a
Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree
distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient
networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other
dynamical processes in real network systems.

The Plasma Puddle as a Perturbative Black Hole,"Clifford Cheung, Jared Kaplan","  We argue that the weak coupling regime of a large N gauge theory in the Higgs
phase contains black hole-like objects. These so-called ``plasma puddles'' are
meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we
call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on
the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own
interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.

"Aspects of stochastic resonance in reaction-diffusion systems: The
  nonequilibrium-potential approach","Horacio S. Wio (1) and Roberto R. Deza (2) ((1) Instituto de F\'isica
  de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria and CSIC, Santander, Spain, (2)
  Departamento de F\'isica, FCEyN, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Mar
  del Plata, Argentina)","  We analyze several aspects of the phenomenon of stochastic resonance in
reaction-diffusion systems, exploiting the nonequilibrium potential's
framework. The generalization of this formalism (sketched in the appendix) to
extended systems is first carried out in the context of a simplified scalar
model, for which stationary patterns can be found analytically. We first show
how system-size stochastic resonance arises naturally in this framework, and
then how the phenomenon of array-enhanced stochastic resonance can be further
enhanced by letting the diffusion coefficient depend on the field. A yet less
trivial generalization is exemplified by a stylized version of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigm of the activator-inhibitor class. After
discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from
it -through an adiabatic-like elimination of the inhibitor field- an effective
scalar model that includes a nonlocal contribution. Studying the role played by
the range of the nonlocal kernel and its effect on stochastic resonance, we
find an optimal range that maximizes the system's response.

Distortion of Gravitational-Wave Packets Due to their Self-Gravity,"Bence Kocsis, Abraham Loeb (Harvard)","  When a source emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over a short period of time,
the leading edge of the GW signal is redshifted more than the inner boundary of
the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the
self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for
GW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the
evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the
source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration
of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be
relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a
radius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge
between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated
GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001. Accounting for the wave
distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in
numerical simulations.

"Fermionic approach to the evaluation of integrals of rational symmetric
  functions",John Harnad and Alexander Yu. Orlov,"  We use the fermionic construction of two-matrix model partition functions to
evaluate integrals over rational symmetric functions. This approach is
complementary to the one used in the paper ``Integrals of Rational Symmetric

where these integrals were evaluated by a direct method.

"Old Main-Sequence Turnoff Photometry in the Small Magellanic Cloud. I.
  Constraints on the Star Formation History in Different Fields","Noelia E. D. Noel, Carme Gallart, Edgardo Costa and Rene A. Mendez","  We present ground-based B and R-band color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs),
reaching the oldest main-sequence turnoffs with good photometric accuracy for
twelve fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our fields, located between
~1 and ~4 degrees from the center of the galaxy, are situated in different
parts of the SMC such as the ""Wing'' area, and towards the West and South. In
this paper we perform a first analysis of the stellar content in our SMC fields
through comparison with theoretical isochrones and color functions (CFs). We
find that the underlying spheroidally distributed population is composed of
both intermediate-age and old stars and that its age composition does not show
strong galacto-centric gradients. The three fields situated toward the east, in
the Wing region, show very active current star formation. However, only in the
eastern field closest to the center do we find an enhancement of recent star
formation with respect to a constant SFR(t). The fields corresponding to the
western side of the SMC present a much less populated young MS, and the CF
analysis indicates that the SFR(t) greatly diminished around 2 Gyr ago in these
parts. Field smc0057, the closest to the center of the galaxy and located in
the southern part, shows recent star formation, while the rest of the southern
fields present few bright MS stars. The structure of the red clump in all the
CMDs is consistent with the large amount of intermediate-age stars inferred
from the CMDs and color functions. None of the SMC fields presented here are
dominated by old stellar populations, a fact that is in agreement with the lack
of a conspicuous horizontal branch in all these SMC CMDs. This could indicate
that a disk population is ruling over a possible old halo in all the observed
fields.

Curvature perturbations from ekpyrotic collapse with multiple fields,"Kazuya Koyama, Shuntaro Mizuno and David Wands","  A scale-invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during
collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have
steep negative exponential potentials. The scale invariance of the spectrum is
realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field. This instability
drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old
ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field. We show that the transition
from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse
automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling
solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late-time attractor. The
final amplitude of the comoving curvature perturbation is determined by the
Hubble scale at the transition.

Asymmetric Di-jet Production in Polarized Hadronic Collisions,"Jian-Wei Qiu, Werner Vogelsang, Feng Yuan","  Using the collinear QCD factorization approach, we study the
single-transverse-spin dependent cross section Delta sigma(S_perp) for the
hadronic production of two jets of momenta P_1=P+q/2 and P_2=-P+q/2. We
consider the kinematic region where the transverse components of the momentum
vectors satisfy P_perp >> q_perp >> Lambda_QCD. For the case of initial-state
gluon radiation, we show that at the leading power in q_perp/P_perp and at the
lowest non-trivial perturbative order, the dependence of Delta sigma(S_perp) on
q_perp decouples from that on P_perp, so that the cross section can be
factorized into a hard part that is a function only of the single scale P_perp,
and into perturbatively generated transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distributions with transverse momenta k_perp = O(q_perp).

"Information, information processing and gravity",Stephen D.H. Hsu,"  I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processing
by gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processing
require energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or black
hole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically,
I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Once
the hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:
the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order the
Planck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a bound
on the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final section
I discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of information
in the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universe
are determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on a
talk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University)
workshop on black holes and quantum information.

  Fe, NM, USA)","  The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purely
noise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian and
white in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. The
potential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for a
study of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task is
facilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochastic
differential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that of
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and a
variance reduced by the self-correlation time (\tau), and whose effect on the
NIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is when
the stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\emph{Gaussian} which, being a
\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \emph{compact-support} one for
(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure from
Gaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and other
phenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-field
approximation and with an emphasis on the \emph{order parameter} and the
``\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'
statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\tau), it is shown that
whereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect of
self-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interesting
effect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.

  (Florida), Masatoshi Imanishi (NAO), William B. Sparks (STScI), James
  Radomski (Gemini)","  We discuss Subaru and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy of M87
in the mid-infrared from 5-35 um. These observations allow us to investigate
mid-IR emission mechanisms in the core of M87 and to establish that the
flaring, variable jet component HST-1 is not a major contributor to the mid-IR
flux. The Spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum of
the knot A/B complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.
However, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}
spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degrading
of resolution with wavelength, are included. The Spitzer data show a clear
excess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, which
we model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of
55 \pm 10 K, with an IR luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. Given
Spitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclear
spectrum could be located anywhere within ~5'' (390 pc) of the nucleus. In any
case, the ratio of AGN thermal to bolometric luminosity indicates that M87 does
not contain the IR-bright torus that classical unified AGN schemes invoke.
However, this result is consistent with theoretical predictions for
low-luminosity AGNs

Fermionic construction of tau functions and random processes,John Harnad and Alexander Yu. Orlov,"  Tau functions expressed as fermionic expectation values are shown to provide
a natural and straightforward description of a number of random processes and
statistical models involving hard core configurations of identical particles on
the integer lattice, like a discrete version simple exclusion processes (ASEP),
nonintersecting random walkers, lattice Coulomb gas models and others, as well
as providing a powerful tool for combinatorial calculations involving paths
between pairs of partitions. We study the decay of the initial step function
within the discrete ASEP (d-ASEP) model as an example.

Novelty and Collective Attention,Fang Wu and Bernardo A. Huberman,"  The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where
millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to
understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among
large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among
one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to
thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a
dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements
indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law,
suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.

Characterization of open cluster remnants,"D.B Pavani, E.Bica","  Despite progress in the theoretical knowledge of open cluster remnants and
the growing search for observational identifications in recent years, open
questions still remain. The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants and
criteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this work
we present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a view
of their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnant
candidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. These
data provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria for
characterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties into
account. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structural
properties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) to
test for any similarity between objects and fields with a statistical
comparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)
to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an index
of isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objective
comparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objective
analysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in the
sample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected for
dynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stages
among remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. The
low stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of the
construction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams. The distributions of
remnants in the composite diagrams resemble the single-star and unresolved
binary star distributions of open clusters.

Hall conductivity from dyonic black holes,Sean A. Hartnoll and Pavel Kovtun,"  A class of strongly interacting 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories in a
transverse magnetic field can be studied using the AdS/CFT duality. We compute
zero momentum hydrodynamic response functions of maximally supersymmetric 2+1
dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at the conformal fixed point, in the large
N limit. With background magnetic field B and electric charge density rho, the
Hall conductivity is found to be rho/B. The result, anticipated on kinematic
grounds in field theory, is obtained from perturbations of a four dimensional
AdS black hole with both electric and magnetic charges.

results in commensurate insulating and incommensurate superconducting cuprates,
these results further support the general scaling prediction for square-lattice
quantum spin S=1/2 systems. The width of incommensurate peaks in
La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 scales to a similar finite value as at optimal doping,
strongly suggesting that they are similarly distant from a quantum critical
point. They might both be limited to a finite correlation length by the partial
spin-glass freezing.

Binary Capture Rates for Massive Protostars,"Nickolas Moeckel, John Bally","  The high multiplicity of massive stars in dense, young clusters is
established early in their evolution. The mechanism behind this remains
unresolved. Recent results suggest that massive protostars may capture
companions through disk interactions with much higher efficiency than their
solar mass counterparts. However, this conclusion is based on analytic
determinations of capture rates and estimates of the robustness of the
resulting binaries. We present the results of coupled n-body and SPH
simulations of star-disk encounters to further test the idea that disk-captured
binaries contribute to the observed multiplicity of massive stars.

"Sharp Asymptotics for KPP Pulsating Front Speed-up and Diffusion

Pulsating Front Speed-up and Quenching of Reaction by Fast Advection,Andrej Zlatos,"  We consider reaction-diffusion equations with combustion-type non-linearities
in two dimensions and study speed-up of their pulsating fronts by general
periodic incompressible flows with a cellular structure. We show that the
occurence of front speed-up in the sense $\lim_{A\to\infty} c_*(A)=\infty$,
with $A$ the amplitude of the flow and $c_*(A)$ the (minimal) front speed, only
depends on the geometry of the flow and not on the reaction function. In
particular, front speed-up happens for KPP reactions if and only if it does for
ignition reactions. We also show that the flows which achieve this speed-up are
precisely those which, when scaled properly, are able to quench any ignition
reaction.

Electroweak Higgs as a pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance,"Robert Foot, Archil Kobakhidze and Raymond R. Volkas","  We point out that it is possible to associate the electroweak Higgs boson
with the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, thus resolving the
hierarchy problem in a technically natural way. We illustrate this idea with
two specific gauge models. Besides being consistent with all currently
available experimental data, both models maintain the predictive power of the
standard model, since the first model has only one additional parameter beyond
the standard model, and the second has the same number of free parameters as
the standard model.

"A linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model of self-synchronizing
  oscillators",David C. Roberts,"  The present paper introduces a linear reformulation of the Kuramoto model
describing a self-synchronizing phase transition in a system of globally
coupled oscillators that in general have different characteristic frequencies.
The reformulated model provides an alternative coherent framework through which
one can analytically tackle synchronization problems that are not amenable to
the original Kuramoto analysis. It allows one to solve explicitly for the
synchronization order parameter and the critical point of 1) the full
phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators
(unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the
mean-field limit) and 2) a new class of continuum systems. It also makes it
possible to probe the system's dynamics as it moves towards a steady state.
While discussion in this paper is restricted to systems with global coupling,
the new formalism introduced by the linear reformulation also lends itself to
solving systems that exhibit local or asymmetric coupling.

certain class of manganites, where localization effects within the clusters can
be neglected.

resulting from the ab initio tight-binding density functional theory (DFT) code
FIREBALL and the empirical, nearest-neighbor pi-bond model are compared for all
semiconducting n values 5 <(=) n <(=) 35. The DFT values for the effective
masses differ from the pi-bond values by +(-) 9% over the range of n values, 17
<(=) n <(=) 29, most important for electronic device applications. Over the
range 13 <(=) n <(=) 35, the DFT bandgaps are less than the empirical bandgaps
by 20-180 meV depending on the functional and the n value. The pi-bond model
gives results that differ signifcantly from the DFT results when the CNT
diameter goes below 1 nm due to the large curvature of the CNT. The pi-bond
model quickly becomes inaccurate away from the bandedges for a (10, 0) CNT, and
it is completely inaccurate for n <(=) 8.

infrared excess characteristic of circumstellar dust, but a flat-disk model
cannot reproduce the data unless there are grains as warm as 1700 K and perhaps
not even then. Our data support the previous suggestion that the metals in the

entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections
between the concurrence (negativity) and the decoherence factors are given for
two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner

fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental
system.

"The Deviation of the Vacuum Refractive Index Induced by a Static

proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the observational
result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the
corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an
analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static
gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index
is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other
is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the
effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that
the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.

Deaconstructing Functions on Quadratic Surfaces into Multipoles,Gabriel Katz,"  Any homogeneous polynomial $P(x, y, z)$ of degree $d$, being restricted to a
unit sphere $S^2$, admits essentially a unique representation of the form
$\lambda + \sum_{k = 1}^d [\prod_{j = 1}^k L_{kj}]$, where $L_{kj}$'s are
linear forms in $x, y$ and $z$ and $\lambda$ is a real number. The coefficients
of these linear forms, viewed as 3D vectors, are called \emph{multipole}
vectors of $P$. In this paper we consider similar multipole representations of
polynomial and analytic functions on other quadratic surfaces $Q(x, y, z) = c$,
real and complex. Over the complex numbers, the above representation is not
unique, although the ambiguity is essentially finite. We investigate the
combinatorics that depicts this ambiguity. We link these results with some
classical theorems of harmonic analysis, theorems that describe decompositions
of functions into sums of spherical harmonics. We extend these classical
theorems (which rely on our understanding of the Laplace operator
$\Delta_{S^2}$) to more general differential operators $\Delta_Q$ that are
constructed with the help of the quadratic form $Q(x, y, z)$. Then we introduce
modular spaces of multipoles. We study their intricate geometry and topology
using methods of algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The multipole
spaces are ramified over vector or projective spaces, and the compliments to
the ramification sets give rise to a rich family of $K(\pi, 1)$-spaces, where
$\pi$ runs over a variety of modified braid groups.

and resolidification by a ns pulsed laser, spatially correlated interfacial
nanostructures can result from a competition among several possible thin film
self-organizing processes. Here we investigate self-organization and the
ensuing length scales when Co films (1-8 nm thick) on SiO_{\text{2}} surfaces
are repeatedly and rapidly melted by non-uniform (interference) laser
irradiation. Pattern evolution produces nanowires, which eventually break-up
into nanoparticles exhibiting spatial order in the nearest neighbor spacing,
\lambda_{NN2}.The scaling behavior is consistent with pattern formation by
thermocapillary flow and a Rayleigh-like instability. For h_{0}\leq2 nm, a
hydrodynamic instability of a spinodally unstable film leads to the formation
of nanoparticles.

domain where typical morphological classification schemes hardly work
efficiently. We have derived an empirical color-redshift relation of the red
sequence galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. By applying this
relation to our photometry catalog and searching for any spatial overdensities,
we have found two galaxy clusters and one nearby galaxy group.

"Confirmation of Cylindrical Perfect Invisibility Cloak Using
  Fourier-Bessel Analysis","Zhichao Ruan, Min Yan, Curtis W. Neff, and Min Qiu","  A cylindrical wave expansion method is developed to obtain the scattering
field for an ideal two-dimensional cylindrical invisibility cloak. A near-ideal
model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the
inner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal
material parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying
the change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal
one. However, due to the slow convergence of the zero$^{th}$ order scattering
coefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field
scattering and penetration.

Sufficiency Criterion for the Validity of the Adiabatic Approximation,"D M Tong, K Singh, L C Kwek, C H OH","  We examine the quantitative condition which has been widely used as a
criterion for the adiabatic approximation but was recently found insufficient.
Our results indicate that the usual quantitative condition is sufficient for a
special class of quantum mechanical systems. For general systems, it may not be
sufficient, but it along with additional conditions is sufficient. The usual
quantitative condition and the additional conditions constitute a general
criterion for the validity of the adiabatic approximation, which is applicable
to all $N-$dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we illustrate the use of the
general quantitative criterion in some physical models.

"Five-dimensional N = 1 AdS superspace: Geometry, off-shell multiplets
  and dynamics","Sergei M. Kuzenko, Gabriele Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli","  As a step towards formulating projective superspace techniques for
supergravity theories with eight supercharges, this work is devoted to field
theory in five-dimensional N = 1 anti-de Sitter superspace AdS^{5|8} =
SU(2,2|1)/SO(4,1) x U(1) which is a maximally symmetric curved background. We
develop the differential geometry of AdS^{5|8} and describe its isometries in
terms of Killing supervectors. Various off-shell supermultiplets in AdS^{5|8} x
S^2 are defined, and supersymmetric actions are constructed both in harmonic
and projective superspace approaches. Several families of supersymmetric
theories are presented including nonlinear sigma-models, Chern-Simons theories
and vector-tensor dynamical systems. Using a suitable coset representative, we
make use of the coset construction to develop an explicit realization for one
half of the superspace AdS^{5|8} as a trivial fiber bundle with fibers
isomorophic to four-dimensional Minkowski superspace.

Domain wall entropy of the bimodal two-dimensional Ising spin glass,A. Aromsawa and J. Poulter,"  We report calculations of the domain wall entropy for the bimodal
two-dimensional Ising spin glass in the critical ground state. The L * L system
sizes are large with L up to 256. We find that it is possible to fit the
variance of the domain wall entropy to a power function of L. However, the
quality of the data distributions are unsatisfactory with large L > 96.
Consequently, it is not possible to reliably determine the fractal dimension of
the domain walls.

Magnetic structure of CeRhIn$_{5}$ under magnetic field,"S. Raymond, E. Ressouche, G. Knebel, D. Aoki and J. Flouquet","  The magnetically ordered ground state of CeRhIn$_{5}$ at ambient pressure and
zero magnetic field is an incomensurate helicoidal phase with the propagation
vector $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and the magnetic moment in the basal plane of
the tetragonal structure. We determined by neutron diffraction the two
different magnetically ordered phases of CeRhIn$_{5}$ evidenced by bulk
measurements under applied magnetic field in its basal plane. The low
temperature high magnetic phase corresponds to a sine-wave structure of the
magnetization being commensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 1/4). At high
temperature, the phase is incommensurate with $\bf{k}$=(1/2, 1/2, 0.298) and a
possible small ellipticity. The propagation vector of this phase is the same as
the one of the zero-field structure.

pseudogap in the density of states of quarks. In the chiral transition, three
collective excitations appear in the quark spectrum.

  Swinburne University, (6) University of Waterloo)","  A new kinematic and dynamic study of the halo of the giant elliptical galaxy,
NGC 5128, is presented. From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340
globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotation
axis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for the
halo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radial
dependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular cluster
sample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)
globular clusters. Our results show the kinematics of the metal-rich and
metal-poor subpopulations are quite similar. The kinematics are compared to the
planetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regions
of the halo. The total mass of NGC 5128 is found using the Tracer Mass
estimator (Evans et al. 2003), to determine the mass supported by internal
random motions, and the spherical component of the Jeans equation to determine
the mass supported by rotation. We find a total mass of (1.0+/-0.2) x 10^(12)
Msun from the planetary nebulae data out to a projected radius of 90 kpc and
(1.3+/-0.5) x 10^(12) Msun from the globular clusters out to a projected radius
of 50 kpc. Lastly, we present a new and homogeneous catalog of known globular
clusters in NGC 5128. This catalog combines all previous definitive cluster
identifications from radial velocity studies and HST imaging studies, as well
as 80 new globular clusters from a study of M.A. Beasley et al. (2007, in

Topological Properties of Phase Singularities in Wave Fields,"Yi-Shi Duan, Ji-Rong Ren, Tao Zhu","  Phase singularities as topological objects of wave fields appear in a variety
of physical, chemical, and biological scenarios. In this paper, by making use
of the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, we study the topological
properties of the phase singularities in two and three dimensional space in
details. The topological inner structure of the phase singularities are
obtained, and the topological charge of the phase singularities are expressed
by the topological numbers: Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees. Furthermore, the
topological invariant of the closed and knotted phase singularities in three
dimensional space are also discussed in details.

  John A. Johnson","  We report the detection of five Jovian mass planets orbiting high metallicity
stars. Four of these stars were first observed as part of the N2K program and
exhibited low RMS velocity scatter after three consecutive observations.
However, follow-up observations over the last three years now reveal the
presence of longer period planets with orbital periods ranging from 21 days to
a few years. HD 11506 is a G0V star with a planet of \msini = 4.74 \mjup in a
3.85 year orbit. HD 17156 is a G0V star with a 3.12 \mjup planet in a 21.2 day
orbit. The eccentricity of this orbit is 0.67, one of the highest known for a
planet with a relatively short period. The orbital period for this planet
places it in a region of parameter space where relatively few planets have been
detected. HD 125612 is a G3V star with a planet of \msini = 3.5 \mjup in a 1.4
year orbit. HD 170469 is a G5IV star with a planet of \msini = 0.67 \mjup in a
3.13 year orbit. HD 231701 is an F8V star with planet of 1.08 \mjup in a 142
day orbit. All of these stars have supersolar metallicity. Three of the five
stars were observed photometrically but showed no evidence of brightness
variability. A transit search conducted for HD 17156 was negative but covered
only 25% of the search space and so is not conclusive.

in high energy heavy ion collisions utilizing Chebyshev expansion coefficients.
These coefficients have proved to be very efficient in investigating the
pattern of fluctuations in neutral pion fraction. For the anticentauro like
events, the magnitude of first few coefficients is strongly enhanced (~3 times)
as compared to those of normal HIJING events. Various characteristics of
Chebyshev coefficients are studied in detail and the probability of formation
of exotic events is calculated from the simulated events.

"Finite-size scaling of pseudo-critical point distributions in the random
  transverse-field Ising chain","Ferenc Igl\'oi, Yu-Cheng Lin, Heiko Rieger, C\'ecile Monthus","  We study the distribution of finite size pseudo-critical points in a
one-dimensional random quantum magnet with a quantum phase transition described
by an infinite randomness fixed point. Pseudo-critical points are defined in
three different ways: the position of the maximum of the average entanglement
entropy, the scaling behavior of the surface magnetization, and the energy of a
soft mode. All three lead to a log-normal distribution of the pseudo-critical
transverse fields, where the width scales as $L^{-1/\nu}$ with $\nu=2$ and the
shift of the average value scales as $L^{-1/\nu_{typ}}$ with $\nu_{typ}=1$,
which we related to the scaling of average and typical quantities in the
critical region.

On the Kaehler rank of compact complex surfaces,Matei Toma,"  Harvey and Lawson introduced the Kaehler rank and computed it in connection
to the cone of positive exact currents of bidimension (1,1) for many classes of

surfaces. Our main tool is the reduction to the dynamics of associated
holomorphic contractions.

"Novel algorithm to calculate hypervolume indicator of Pareto
  approximation set",Qing Yang and Shengchao Ding,"  Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure for comparing
Pareto approximation set generated by multi-objective optimizers. The best
known algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a
run time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a
recursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator
of a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out
multiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting
reference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen
to minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity
analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time
and $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.

Statistical properties of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar,M.V. Popov and B. Stappers,"  We have studied the statistics of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar for the
first time with particular reference to their widths. We have analyzed data
collected during 3.5 hours of observations conducted with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope operated in a tied-array mode at a frequency of 1200
MHz. The PuMa pulsar backend provided voltage recording of X and Y linear
polarization states in two conjugate 10 MHz bands. We restricted the time
resolution to 4 microseconds to match the scattering on the interstellar
inhomogeneities. In total about 18000 giant pulses (GP) were detected in full
intensity with a threshold level of 6 sigma. Cumulative probability
distributions (CPD) of giant pulse energies were analyzed for groups of GPs
with different effective widths in the range 4 to 65 microseconds. The CPDs
were found to manifest notable differences for the different GP width groups.
The slope of a power-law fit to the high-energy portion of the CPDs evolves
from -1.7 to -3.2 when going from the shortest to the longest GPs. There are
breaks in the CPD power-law fits indicating flattening at low energies with
indices varying from -1.0 to -1.9 for the short and long GPs respectively. The
GPs with a stronger peak flux density were found to be of shorter duration. We
compare our results with previously published data and discuss the importance
of these peculiarities in the statistical properties of GPs for the heoretical
understanding of the emission mechanism responsible for GP generation.

A Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Network Coding,"Minkyu Kim, Varun Aggarwal, Una-May O'Reilly, Muriel Medard","  We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along
genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member
of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a
subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer
a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the
computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate
solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal
domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead
to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments
yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring
significant penalties.

"Evaluation of the Axial Vector Commutator Sum Rule for Pion-Pion
  Scattering",Stephen L. Adler and F. J. Yndurain,"  We consider the sum rule proposed by one of us (SLA), obtained by taking the
expectation value of an axial vector commutator in a state with one pion. The
sum rule relates the pion decay constant to integrals of pion-pion cross
sections, with one pion off the mass shell. We remark that recent data on
pion-pion scattering allow a precise evaluation of the sum rule. We also
discuss the related Adler--Weisberger sum rule (obtained by taking the
expectation value of the same commutator in a state with one nucleon),
especially in connection with the problem of extrapolation of the pion momentum
off its mass shell. We find, with current data, that both the pion-pion and
pion-nucleon sum rules are satisfied to better than six percent, and we give
detailed estimates of the experimental and extrapolation errors in the closure
discrepancies.

"Colour pairs for constraining the age and metallicity of stellar
  populations",Zhongmu Li and Zhanwen Han,"  Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability
of using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar
age--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population
parameters (age and metallicity). The relative age and metallicity
sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,
H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for
breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty
parameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be
used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be
very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In
detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best
pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two
stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89
Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties
in colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)],
[(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the
two parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to
both UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours
or ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. The results also show
that the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) can be
estimated via photometry data. It is also shown that the colours can be used in
conjunction with line indices to measure stellar-population parameters.

stars. The effect is shown to be especially strong for large kick amplitudes

coalescences up to an order of magnitude with respect to the rates calculated
for random kicks. The spin-kick correlation also leads to much narrower NS
spin-orbit misalignments compared to random kicks.

Electronic structure of the zigzag spin-chain compound In$_2$VO$_5$,"Udo Schwingenschl\""ogl","  Band structure calculations within the local spin-density approximation are
presented in order to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of the
zigzag spin-chain compound In$_2$VO$_5$. The essential structural feature of
the system is a double chain of VO$_6$-octahedra, which leads to competing
intrachain and interchain magnetic couplings. Frustration of the spin-chains is
expected for the proposed antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures.
However, the band calculations show that the experimental room temperature
crystal structure is incompatible with antiferromagnetism. Both the intrachain
and interchain coupling is found to be ferromagnetic.

Elasticity with Arbitrarily Shaped Inhomogeneity,"Joachim Mathiesen, Itamar Procaccia and Ido Regev","  A classical problem in elasticity theory involves an inhomogeneity embedded
in a material of given stress and shear moduli. The inhomogeneity is a region
of arbitrary shape whose stress and shear moduli differ from those of the
surrounding medium. In this paper we present a new, semi-analytic method for
finding the stress tensor for an infinite plate with such an inhomogeneity. The
solution involves two conformal maps, one from the inside and the second from
the outside of the unit circle to the inside, and respectively outside, of the
inhomogeneity. The method provides a solution by matching the conformal maps on
the boundary between the inhomogeneity and the surrounding material. This
matching converges well only for relatively mild distortions of the unit circle
due to reasons which will be discussed in the article. We provide a comparison
of the present result to known previous results.

The dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn in the gaseous proto-planetary disk,"Morbidelli Alessandro (OCA), Aurelien Crida (OCA)","  We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter and
Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to
the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), by
exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a
new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous
evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and
Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up
locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the
resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in
the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for
the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.
If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or
reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,
this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. We
discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in
Tsiganis et al. (2005) and Gomes et al. (2005) to explain the current orbital
architecture of the giant planets and the origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment
of the Moon.

Kinetic Theory for Binary Granular Mixtures at Low-Density,Vicente Garzo,"  Many features of granular media can be modelled as a fluid of hard spheres
with {\em inelastic} collisions. Under rapid flow conditions, the macroscopic
behavior of grains can be described through hydrodynamic equations. At
low-density, a fundamental basis for the derivation of the hydrodynamic
equations and explicit expressions for the transport coefficients appearing in
them is provided by the Boltzmann kinetic theory conveniently modified to
account for inelastic binary collisions. The goal of this chapter is to give an
overview of the recent advances made for binary granular gases by using kinetic
theory tools. Some of the results presented here cover aspects such as
transport properties, energy nonequipartition, instabilities, segregation or
mixing, non-Newtonian behavior, .... In addition, comparison of the analytical
results with those obtained from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations
is also carried out, showing the reliability of kinetic theory to describe
granular flows even for strong dissipation.

Optical carrier wave shocking: detection and dispersion,"P. Kinsler, S.B.P. Radnor, J.C.A. Tyrrell, G.H.C. New","  Carrier wave shocking is studied using the Pseudo-Spectral Spatial Domain
(PSSD) technique. We describe the shock detection diagnostics necessary for
this numerical study, and verify them against theoretical shocking predictions
for the dispersionless case. These predictions show Carrier Envelope Phase
(CEP) and pulse bandwidth sensitivity in the single-cycle regime. The flexible
dispersion management offered by PSSD enables us to independently control the
linear and nonlinear dispersion. Customized dispersion profiles allow us to
analyze the development of both carrier self-steepening and shocks. The results
exhibit a marked asymmetry between normal and anomalous dispersion, both in the
limits of the shocking regime and in the (near) shocked pulse waveforms.
Combining these insights, we offer some suggestions on how carrier shocking (or
at least extreme self-steepening) might be realised experimentally.

"Spin-polarized transport through weakly coupled double quantum dots in
  the Coulomb-blockade regime",I. Weymann,"  We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly
coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the
electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order
single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the
occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias
maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the
value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both
magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling
through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel
magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on
temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation.
Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.

Possible origin of Larson's lows,A.W. Zaharow,"  It was found that approximately constant column densities of giant molecular

(clumps and cores) embedded into the cloud and its gravitational field. Derived
existence condition do not rely on any internal dynamic of a cloud and embedded
objects.

"Double Neutron Stars: Evidence For Two Different Neutron-Star Formation
  Mechanisms","E.P.J. van den Heuvel (University of Amsterdam, University of
  California)","  Six of the eight double neutron stars known in the Galactic disk have low
orbital eccentricities (< 0.27) indicating that their second-born neutron stars
received only very small velocity kicks at birth. This is similar to the case
of the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron stars
received hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses of
the second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity double
neutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is argued
that these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capture
collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive than
about 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron stars
were formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass. The
absence of low-velocity single young radio pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005) is
consistent with the model proposed by Podsiadlowski et al. (2004), in which the
electron-capture collapse of degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores can only occur in binary
systems, and not in single stars.

"The impact of radio feedback from active galactic nuclei in cosmological
  simulations: Formation of disk galaxies","Takashi Okamoto (1), Rodrigo S. Nemmen (2), Richard G. Bower (1) ((1)
  Durham University, (2) UFRGS)","  In this paper, we present a new implementation of feedback due to active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We
assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the

"Y-formalism and $b$ ghost in the Non-minimal Pure Spinor Formalism of
  Superstrings",Ichiro Oda and Mario Tonin,"  We present the Y-formalism for the non-minimal pure spinor quantization of
superstrings. In the framework of this formalism we compute, at the quantum
level, the explicit form of the compound operators involved in the construction
of the $b$ ghost, their normal-ordering contributions and the relevant
relations among them. We use these results to construct the quantum-mechanical
$b$ ghost in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism. Moreover we show that this
non-minimal $b$ ghost is cohomologically equivalent to the non-covariant $b$
ghost.

"A multi-transition molecular line study of candidate massive young
  stellar objects associated with methanol masers","M. Szymczak, A. Bartkiewicz, A.M.S. Richards","  We characterize the molecular environment of candidate massive young stellar
objects (MYSOs) signposted by methanol masers. Single pixel observations of 10
transitions of HCO^+, CO and CS isotopomers were carried out, using the IRAM
30m telescope. We studied a sample of 28 targets for which the 6.7GHz maser
emission positions are known with a sub-arcsecond accuracy. The systemic
velocity inferred from the optically thin lines agrees within 3km/s with the
central velocity of the maser emission for most of the sources. About 64% of
the sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CS
species, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of the
widths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maser
line traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Therefore
conditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts of
molecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer parts
associated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditions
based on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine the
input parameters for maser models.

Dynamics of the Tippe Top via Routhian Reduction,M. C. Ciocci and B. Langerock,"  We consider a tippe top modeled as an eccentric sphere, spinning on a
horizontal table and subject to a sliding friction. Ignoring translational
effects, we show that the system is reducible using a Routhian reduction
technique. The reduced system is a two dimensional system of second order
differential equations, that allows an elegant and compact way to retrieve the
classification of tippe tops in six groups as proposed in [1] according to the
existence and stability type of the steady states.

Plasmaneutrino spectrum,A. Odrzywolek,"  Spectrum of the neutrinos produced in the massive photon and longitudal
plasmon decay process has been computed with four levels of approximation for
the dispersion relations. Some analytical formulae in limiting cases are
derived. Interesting conclusions related to previous calculations of the energy
loss in stars are presented. High energy tail of the neutrino spectrum is shown
to be proportional to exp(-E/kT), where E is the neutrino energy and kT is the
temperature of the plasma.

"Quadratic BSDEs with random terminal time and elliptic PDEs in infinite

equations (BSDEs) with random terminal time not necessarily bounded or finite
when the generator F(t,Y,Z) has a quadratic growth in Z. We provide existence
and uniqueness of a bounded solution of such BSDEs and, in the case of infinite
horizon, regular dependence on parameters. The obtained results are then
applied to prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to elliptic
partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces.

Non-minimal Wu-Yang wormhole,"Alexander B. Balakin, Sergey V. Sushkov, Alexei E. Zayats","  We discuss exact solutions of three-parameter non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills
model, which describe the wormholes of a new type. These wormholes are
considered to be supported by SU(2)-symmetric Yang-Mills field, non-minimally
coupled to gravity, the Wu-Yang ansatz for the gauge field being used. We
distinguish between regular solutions, describing traversable non-minimal
Wu-Yang wormholes, and black wormholes possessing one or two event horizons.
The relation between the asymptotic mass of the regular traversable Wu-Yang
wormhole and its throat radius is analysed.

Patterns of dominant flows in the world trade web,"M. Angeles Serrano, Marian Boguna, and Alessandro Vespignani","  The large-scale organization of the world economies is exhibiting
increasingly levels of local heterogeneity and global interdependency.
Understanding the relation between local and global features calls for
analytical tools able to uncover the global emerging organization of the
international trade network. Here we analyze the world network of bilateral
trade imbalances and characterize its overall flux organization, unraveling
local and global high-flux pathways that define the backbone of the trade
system. We develop a general procedure capable to progressively filter out in a
consistent and quantitative way the dominant trade channels. This procedure is
completely general and can be applied to any weighted network to detect the
underlying structure of transport flows. The trade fluxes properties of the
world trade web determines a ranking of trade partnerships that highlights
global interdependencies, providing information not accessible by simple local
analysis. The present work provides new quantitative tools for a dynamical
approach to the propagation of economic crises.

"Hydrogen 2p--2s transition: signals from the epochs of recombination and
  reionization","Shiv. K. Sethi, Ravi Subrahmanyan, D. Anish Roshi","  We propose a method to study the epoch of reionization based on the possible
observation of 2p--2s fine structure lines from the neutral hydrogen outside
the cosmological H {\sc ii} regions enveloping QSOs and other ionizing sources
in the reionization era. We show that for parameters typical of luminous
sources observed at $z \simeq 6.3$ the strength of this signal, which is
proportional to the H {\sc i} fraction, has a brightness temperature $\simeq 20
  \mu K$ for a fully neutral medium. The fine structure line from this redshift
is observable at $\nu \simeq 1 \rm GHz$ and we discuss prospects for the
detection with several operational and future radio telescopes. We also compute
the characteristics of this signal from the epoch of recombination: the peak
brightness is expected to be $\simeq 100 \mu K$; this signal appears in the
frequency range 5-10 MHz. The signal from the recombination era is nearly
impossible to detect owing to the extreme brightness of the Galactic emission
at these frequencies.

"Superconductor strip in a closed magnetic environment: exact analytic
  representation of the critical state",Y.A. Genenko and H. Rauh,"  An exact analytic representation of the critical state of a current-carrying
type-II superconductor strip located inside a cylindrical magnetic cavity of
high permeability is derived. The obtained results show that, when the cavity
radius is small, penetration of magnetic flux fronts is strongly reduced as
compared to the situation in an isolated strip. From our generic representation
it is possible to establish current profiles in closed cavities of various
other geometries too by means of conformal mapping of the basic configuration
addressed.

"Near- and Far-Infrared Counterparts of Millimeter Dust Cores in the Vela
  Molecular Ridge Cloud D","M. De Luca, T. Giannini, D. Lorenzetti, F. Massi, D. Elia, B. Nisini","  The aim of this paper is to identify the young protostellar counterparts
associated to dust millimeter cores of the Vela Molecular Ridge Cloud D through
new IR observations (H_2 narrow-band at 2.12 micron and N broad band at 10.4
micron) along with an investigation performed on the existing IR catalogues.
The association of mm continuum emission with infrared sources from catalogues
(IRAS, MSX, 2MASS), JHK data from the literature and new observations, has been
established according to spatial coincidence, infrared colours and spectral
energy distributions. Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26
unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity. The other
ones are clearly associated with: far-IR sources, H_2 jets or near-IR objects
showing a high intrinsic colour excess. The distribution of the spectral
indices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical of
Class I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0
sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sources
located inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminous
objects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,
testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.
The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,
the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,
even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seems
to reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than any
property intrinsic to the mm-condensations.

"High-precision covariant one-boson-exchange potentials for np scattering
  below 350 MeV",Franz Gross and Alfred Stadler,"  All realistic potential models for the two-nucleon interaction are to some
extent based on boson exchange. However, in order to achieve an essentially
perfect fit to the scattering data, characterized by a chi2/Ndata ~ 1, previous
potentials have abandoned a pure one boson-exchange mechanism (OBE). Using a
covariant theory, we have found a OBE potential that fits the 2006 world np
data below 350 MeV with a chi2/Ndata = 1.06 for 3788 data. Our potential has
fewer adjustable parameters than previous high-precision potentials, and also
reproduces the experimental triton binding energy without introducing
additional irreducible three-nucleon forces.

"CP Violation and Arrows of Time Evolution of a Neutral $K$ or $B$ Meson
  from an Incoherent to a Coherent State","Ch. Berger, L. Sehgal","  We study the evolution of a neutral $K$ meson prepared as an incoherent equal
mixture of $K^0$ and $\bar{K^0}$. Denoting the density matrix by $\rho(t) =
{1/2} N(t) [\1 + \vec{\zeta}(t) \cdot \vec{\sigma} ] $, the norm of the state
$N(t)$ is found to decrease monotonically from one to zero, while the magnitude
of the Stokes vector $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ increases monotonically from zero to
one. This property qualifies these observables as arrows of time. Requiring
monotonic behaviour of $N(t)$ for arbitrary values of $\gamma_L, \gamma_S$ and
$\Delta m$ yields a bound on the CP-violating overlap $\delta =
\braket{K_L}{K_S}$, which is similar to, but weaker than, the known unitarity
bound. A similar requirement on $|\vec{\zeta}(t)|$ yields a new bound,
$\delta^2 < {1/2} (\frac{\Delta \gamma}{\Delta m}) \sinh (\frac{3\pi}{4}
\frac{\Delta \gamma}{\Delta m})$ which is particularly effective in limiting
the CP-violating overlap in the $B^0$-$\bar{B^0}$ system. We obtain the Stokes
parameter $\zeta_3(t)$ which shows how the average strangeness of the beam
evolves from zero to $\delta$. The evolution of the Stokes vector from
$|\vec{\zeta}| = 0$ to $|\vec{\zeta}| = 1$ has a resemblance to an order
parameter of a system undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Residual entropy in a model for the unfolding of single polymer chains,"Erik Van der Straeten, Jan Naudts","  We study the unfolding of a single polymer chain due to an external force. We
use a simplified model which allows to perform all calculations in closed form
without assuming a Boltzmann-Gibbs form for the equilibrium distribution.
Temperature is then defined by calculating the Legendre transform of the
entropy under certain constraints. The application of the model is limited to
flexible polymers. It exhibits a gradual transition from compact globule to
rod. The boundary line between these two phases shows reentrant behavior. This
behavior is explained by the presence of residual entropy.

"Generalization of Einstein-Lovelock theory to higher order dilaton
  gravity","D. Konikowska, M. Olechowski","  A higher order theory of dilaton gravity is constructed as a generalization
of the Einstein-Lovelock theory of pure gravity. Its Lagrangian contains terms
with higher powers of the Riemann tensor and of the first two derivatives of
the dilaton. Nevertheless, the resulting equations of motion are quasi-linear
in the second derivatives of the metric and of the dilaton. This property is
crucial for the existence of brane solutions in the thin wall limit. At each
order in derivatives the contribution to the Lagrangian is unique up to an
overall normalization. Relations between symmetries of this theory and the
O(d,d) symmetry of the string-inspired models are discussed.

"Fluctuations of the partial filling factors in competitive RSA from
  binary mixtures",Arsen V. Subashiev and Serge Luryi,"  Competitive random sequential adsorption on a line from a binary mix of
incident particles is studied using both an analytic recursive approach and
Monte Carlo simulations. We find a strong correlation between the small and the
large particle distributions so that while both partial contributions to the
fill factor fluctuate widely, the variance of the total fill factor remains
relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite
different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger
particle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of
partial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional
variance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the
fluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles. We discuss the
implications of our results to semiconductor high-energy gamma detectors where
the detector energy resolution is controlled by correlations in the cascade
energy branching process.

  I. HR 4049 - The Winnowing Flow Observed?","Kenneth H. Hinkle (1), Sean D. Brittain (2), David L. Lambert (3) ((1)
  NOAO, (2) Clemson University, (3) The W.J. McDonald Observatory)","  High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3-4.6 micron region is
reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR
4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and
several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the
near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission
through the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.
The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All the
spectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to be
circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the
oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to the
previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line
profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer
near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and
the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M_AI~0.58 Msolar
and M_MV~0.34 Msolar. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity
of $\gtrsim$ 1 km/s. The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar
abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance
winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the
subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the
HR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values:
12C/13C=6^{+9}_{-4} and 16O/17O>200.

"On the Entropy Function and the Attractor Mechanism for Spherically
  Symmetric Extremal Black Holes",Rong-Gen Cai and Li-Ming Cao,"  In this paper we elaborate on the relation between the entropy formula of
Wald and the ""entropy function"" method proposed by A. Sen. For spherically
symmetric extremal black holes, it is shown that the expression of extremal
black hole entropy given by A. Sen can be derived from the general entropy
definition of Wald, without help of the treatment of rescaling the AdS_2 part
of near horizon geometry of extremal black holes. In our procedure, we only
require that the surface gravity approaches to zero, and it is easy to
understand the Legendre transformation of f, the integration of Lagrangian
density on the horizon, with respect to the electric charges. Since the Noether
charge form can be defined in an ""off-shell"" form, we define a corresponding
entropy function, with which one can discuss the attractor mechanism for
extremal black holes with scalar fields.

"Dynamical layer decoupling in a stripe-ordered, high T_c superconductor","Erez Berg, Eduardo Fradkin, Eun-Ah Kim, Steven A. Kivelson, Vadim
  Oganesyan, John Tranquada and Shoucheng Zhang","  In the stripe-ordered state of a strongly-correlated two-dimensional
electronic system, under a set of special circumstances, the superconducting
condensate, like the magnetic order, can occur at a non-zero wave-vector
corresponding to a spatial period double that of the charge order. In this
case, the Josephson coupling between near neighbor planes, especially in a
crystal with the special structure of La_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4, vanishes identically.
We propose that this is the underlying cause of the dynamical decoupling of the
layers recently observed in transport measurements at x=1/8.

  Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ magnetic shape memory alloy","Xavier Moya, Lluis Manosa, Antoni Planes, Seda Aksoy, Mehmet Acet,
  Eberhard F. Wassermann, Thorsten Krenke","  We report on measurements of the adiabatic temperature change in the inverse
magnetocaloric Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$ alloy. It is shown that this alloy
heats up with the application of a magnetic field around the Curie point due to
the conventional magnetocaloric effect. In contrast, the inverse magnetocaloric
effect associated with the martensitic transition results in the unusual
decrease of temperature by adiabatic magnetization. We also provide
magnetization and specific heat data which enable to compare the measured
temperature changes to the values indirectly computed from thermodynamic
relationships. Good agreement is obtained for the conventional effect at the
second-order paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. However, at the first
order structural transition the measured values at high fields are lower than
the computed ones. Irreversible thermodynamics arguments are given to show that
such a discrepancy is due to the irreversibility of the first-order martensitic
transition.

Giant Fluctuations of Coulomb Drag in a Bilayer System,"A. S. Price, A. K. Savchenko, B. N. Narozhny, G. Allison, D. A.
  Ritchie","  We have observed reproducible fluctuations of the Coulomb drag, both as a
function of magnetic field and electron concentration, which are a
manifestation of quantum interference of electrons in the layers. At low
temperatures the fluctuations exceed the average drag, giving rise to random
changes of the sign of the drag. The fluctuations are found to be much larger
than previously expected, and we propose a model which explains their
enhancement by considering fluctuations of local electron properties.

Magnetic superelasticity and inverse magnetocaloric effect in Ni-Mn-In,"Thorsten Krenke, Eyup Duman, Mehmet Acet, and Eberhard F. Wassermann,
  Xavier Moya, Lluis Manosa and Antoni Planes, Emmanuelle Suard and Bachir
  Ouladdiaf","  Applying a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic Ni$_{50}$Mn$_{34}$In$_{16}$
alloy in the martensitic state induces a structural phase transition to the
austenitic state. This is accompanied by a strain which recovers on removing
the magnetic field giving the system a magnetically superelastic character. A
further property of this alloy is that it also shows the inverse magnetocaloric
effect. The magnetic superelasticity and the inverse magnetocaloric effect in
Ni-Mn-In and their association with the first order structural transition is
studied by magnetization, strain, and neutron diffraction studies under
magnetic field.

  Pavlyuk, J. Sollerman, D.Yu. Tsvetkov, M. Turatto, W. Hillebrandt","  An extensive set of optical and NIR photometry and low-resolution spectra the
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2003du was obtained using a number of facilities. The
observations started 13 days before B-band maximum light and continued for 480
days with exceptionally good time sampling. The optical photometry was
calibrated through the S-correction technique.
  The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemble
those of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)
mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5). We derive a B-band stretch parameter of 0.988
(+/-0.003), which corresponds to dM15=1.02 (+/-0.05), indicative of a SN Ia of
standard luminosity. The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by three
methods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distance
modulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIR
bolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule implies
that M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.
Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in the
range 0.6-0.8 M_sun. The spectral evolution of SN 2003du at both optical and
NIR wavelengths also closely resembles normal SNe Ia. In particular, the Si II
ratio at maximum R(Si II)=0.22 (+/-0.02) and the time evolution of the
blueshift velocities of the absorption line minima are typical. The pre-maximum
spectra of SN 2003du showed conspicuous high-velocity features in the Ca II H&K
doublet and infrared triplet, and possibly in Si II 6355, lines. We compare the
time evolution of the profiles of these lines with other well-observed SNe Ia
and we suggest that the peculiar pre-maximum evolution of Si II 6355 line in
many SNe Ia is due to the presence of two blended absorption components.

Outflow and Infall in a Sample of Massive Star Forming Regions,P.D. Klaassen and C.D. Wilson,"  We present single pointing observations of SiO, HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$
from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 massive star forming regions
previously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We
detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the
other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without
ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all
sources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall
candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and
2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections
(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance
of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources
for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect
to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,
we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion
may be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or
protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.

A Rational Approach to Resonance Saturation in large-Nc QCD,P. Masjuan and S. Peris,"  We point out that resonance saturation in QCD can be understood in the
large-Nc limit from the mathematical theory of Pade Approximants to meromorphic
functions. These approximants are rational functions which encompass any
saturation with a finite number of resonances as a particular example,
explaining several results which have appeared in the literature. We review the
main properties of Pade Approximants with the help of a toy model for the
<VV-AA> two-point correlator, paying particular attention to the relationship
among the Chiral Expansion, the Operator Product Expansion and the resonance
spectrum. In passing, we also comment on an old proposal made by Migdal in 1977
which has recently attracted much attention in the context of AdS/QCD models.
Finally, we apply the simplest Pade Approximant to the <VV-AA> correlator in
the real case of QCD. The general conclusion is that a rational approximant may
reliably describe a Green's function in the Euclidean, but the same is not true
in the Minkowski regime due to the appearance of unphysical poles and/or
residues.

Unification and Fermion Mass Structure,Graham Ross and Mario Serna,"  Grand Unified Theories predict relationships between the GUT-scale quark and
lepton masses. Using new data in the context of the MSSM, we update the values
and uncertainties of the masses and mixing angles for the three generations at
the GUT scale. We also update fits to hierarchical patterns in the GUT-scale
Yukawa matrices. The new data shows not all the classic GUT-scale mass
relationships remain in quantitative agreement at small to moderate tan beta.
However, at large tan beta, these discrepancies can be eliminated by finite,
tan beta-enhanced, radiative, threshold corrections if the gluino mass has the
opposite sign to the wino mass.

Cluster tilting for one-dimensional hypersurface singularities,"Igor Burban, Osamu Iyama, Bernhard Keller, Idun Reiten","  In this article we study Cohen-Macaulay modules over one-dimensional

criterion for existence of cluster tilting objects and their complete
description by homological methods, using higher almost split sequences and
results from birational geometry. We obtain a large class of 2-CY tilted
algebras which are finite dimensional symmetric and satisfy $\tau^2=\id$. In
particular, we compute 2-CY tilted algebras for simple and minimally elliptic
curve singularities.

polarization is consistent with three dominant polarizing mechanisms. We
identify three distinct regions of polarization: (a) north of the nucleus,
arising from aligned dust in the NLR, (b) south, east and west of the nucleus,
consistent with dust being channeled toward the central engine and (c) a
central minimum of polarization consistent with a compact (<22pc) torus. These
observations provide continuity between the geometrically and optically thick
torus and the host galaxy's nuclear environments. These images represent the
first published mid-IR polarimetry from an 8-m class telescope and illustrate
the potential of such observations.

"Coupling between magnetic ordering and structural instabilities in
  perovskite biferroics: A first-principles study",Nirat Ray and Umesh V. Waghmare,"  We use first-principles density functional theory-based calculations to
investigate structural instabilities in the high symmetry cubic perovskite
structure of rare-earth (R $=$ La, Y, Lu) and Bi-based biferroic chromites,
focusing on $\Gamma$ and $R$ point phonons of states with para-, ferro-, and
antiferromagnetic ordering. We find that (a) the structure with G-type
antiferromagnetic ordering is most stable, (b) the most dominant structural
instabilities in these oxides are the ones associated with rotations of oxygen
octahedra, and (c) structural instabilities involving changes in Cr-O-Cr bond
angle depend sensitively on the changes in magnetic ordering. The dependence of
structural instabilities on magnetic ordering can be understood in terms of how
super-exchange interactions depend on the Cr-O-Cr bond angles and Cr-O bond
lengths. We demonstrate how adequate buckling of Cr-O-Cr chains can favour
ferromagnetism. Born effective charges (BEC) calculated using the Berry phase
expression are found to be anomalously large for the A-cations, indicating
their chemical relevance to ferroelectric distortions.

"LNRF-velocity hump-induced oscillations of a Keplerian disc orbiting
  near-extreme Kerr black hole: A possible explanation of high-frequency QPOs
  in GRS 1915+105","Z. Stuchlik, P.Slany, G. Torok","  At least four high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) at frequencies
41Hz, 67Hz, 113Hz, and 167Hz were reported in a binary system GRS 1915+105
hosting near-extreme Kerr black hole with a dimensionless spin a>0.98. We use
the idea of oscillations induced by the hump of the orbital velocity profile
(related to locally non-rotating frames - LNRF) in discs orbiting near-extreme
Kerr black holes, which are characterized by a ""humpy frequency"" f_h, that
could excite the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations with frequencies
f_r, f_v. Due to non-linear resonant phenomena the combinational frequencies
are allowed as well. Assuming mass M=14.8M_sun and spin a=0.9998 for the GRS
1915+105 Kerr black hole, the model predicts frequencies f_h=41Hz, f_r=67Hz,
(f_h+f_r)=108Hz, (f_v-f_r)=170Hz corresponding quite well to the observed ones.
For black-hole parameters being in good agreement with those given
observationally, the forced resonant phenomena in non-linear oscillations,
excited by the ""hump-induced"" oscillations in a Keplerian disc, can explain
high-frequency QPOs in GRS 1915+105 within the range of observational errors.

obscured, one of which (NGC 5728) being Compton thick, while at lower energies
the shape and intensity of the scattered/reflected continuum is very different.
Strong iron Kalpha lines are detected in both sources. There are also hints for
the presence of a broad relativistic iron line in NGC 4992.

"Spin-dependence of Ce $4f$ hybridization in magnetically ordered
  systems: A spin-resolved photoemission study of Ce/Fe(110)","Yu. S. Dedkov, M. Fonin, Yu. Kucherenko, S. L. Molodtsov, U.
  R\""udiger, and C. Laubschat","  Spin- and angle-resolved resonant (Ce $4d\to4f$) photoemission spectra of a
monolayer Ce on Fe(110) reveal spin-dependent changes of the Fermi-level peak
intensities. That indicate a spin-dependence of $4f$ hybridization and, thus,
of $4f$ occupancy and local moment. The phenomenon is described in the
framework of the periodic Anderson model by $4f$ electron hopping into the
exchange split Fe 3d derived bands that form a spin-gap at the Fermi energy
around the $\bar{\Gamma}$ point of the surface Brillouin zone.
"
Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow,"Thomas Peters, Joerg Schumacher","  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

"A Novel String Derived Z' With Stable Proton, Light-Neutrinos and
  R-parity violation","Claudio Coriano, Alon E. Faraggi, Marco Guzzi","  The Standard Model indicates the realization of grand unified structures in
nature, and can only be viewed as an effective theory below a higher energy
cutoff. While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediating
operators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the Standard
Model introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,
quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicating
that the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realistic
heterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantum
gravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanation
for the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gauge
symmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,
such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handed
neutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to the
electroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. These
requirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realistic
heterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of a
U(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class of
left-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.
The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to future
experiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of proton
decay mediation. We further show that while the extra U(1) forbids dimension
four baryon number violating operators it allows dimension four lepton number
violating operators and R-parity violation.

immediately deduced from the commutative case.

Evidence for a merger of binary white dwarfs: the case of GD 362,"E. Garcia-Berro, P. Loren-Aguilar, A.G. Pedemonte, J. Isern, P.
  Bergeron, P. Dufour and P. Brassard","  GD 362 is a massive white dwarf with a spectrum suggesting a H-rich
atmosphere which also shows very high abundances of Ca, Mg, Fe and other
metals. However, for pure H-atmospheres the diffusion timescales are so short
that very extreme assumptions have to be made to account for the observed
abundances of metals. The most favored hypothesis is that the metals are
accreted from either a dusty disk or from an asteroid belt. Here we propose
that the envelope of GD 362 is dominated by He, which at these effective
temperatures is almost completely invisible in the spectrum. This assumption
strongly alleviates the problem, since the diffusion timescales are much larger
for He-dominated atmospheres. We also propose that the He-dominated atmosphere
of GD 362 is likely to be the result of the merger of a binary white dwarf.

Lapse of transmission phase and electron molecules in quantum dots,S.A. Gurvitz,"  The puzzling behavior of the transition phase through a quantum dot can be
understood in a natural way via a formation of the electron molecule in the
quantum dot. In this case the resonance tunneling takes place through the
quasi-stationary (doorway) state, which emerges when the number of electrons
occupying the dot reaches a certain ``critical'' value, $N_{cr}$. Our
estimation of this quantity agrees with the experimental data. The dependence
of $N_{cr}$ on the dot's size is predicted as well.

"Quantum-corrected black hole thermodynamics to all orders in the Planck
  length",Khireddine Nouicer,"  We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a
generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We
calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details
the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is
accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity
and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we
obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results
obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading
order in the Planck length.

"
The Measurement Calculus,"Vincent Danos, Elham Kashefi, Prakash Panangaden","  Measurement-based quantum computation has emerged from the physics community
as a new approach to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the
main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more
traditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among
measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way
quantum computer stands out as fundamental.
  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum
computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs,
which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a
denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning
locally and compositionally about these patterns.
  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which
allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.
Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture
based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by
exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory
we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework
we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is
not just particular to the one-way quantum computer.

  interactions","Boris Grbic, Renaud Leturcq, Thomas Ihn, Klaus Ensslin, Dirk Reuter,
  and Andreas D. Wieck","  We have measured highly visible Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in a ring
structure defined by local anodic oxidation on a p-type GaAs heterostructure
with strong spin-orbit interactions. Clear beating patterns observed in the raw
data can be interpreted in terms of a spin geometric phase. Besides h/e
oscillations, we resolve the contributions from the second harmonic of AB
oscillations and also find a beating in these h/2e oscillations. A resistance
minimum at B=0T, present in all gate configurations, is the signature of
destructive interference of the spins propagating along time-reversed paths.

major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality
and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to

"On the interpretation of muon-spin-rotation experiments in the mixed
  state of type-II superconductors",I.L. Landau and H. Keller,"  We argue that claims about magnetic field dependence of the magnetic field
penetration depth lambda, which were made on the basis of moun-spin-rotation
studies of some superconductors, originate from insufficient accuracy of
theoretical models employed for the data analysis. We also reanalyze some of
already published experimental data and demonstrate that numerical calculations
of Brandt [E.H. Brandt, Phys. Rev. B 68, 54506 (2003)] may serve as a reliable
and powerful tool for the analysis of the data collected in experiments with
conventional superconductors. Furthermore, one can use this approach in order
to distinguish between conventional and unconventional superconductors. It is
unfortunate that these calculations have practically never been employed for
such analyses.
"
Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs,"Lenka Zdeborov\'a, Florent Krzakala","  We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random
graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Core-Corona Separation in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,Klaus Werner,"  Simple geometrical considerations show that the collision zone in high energy
nuclear collisions may be divided into a central part (``core''), with high
energy densities, and a peripheral part (``corona''), with smaller energy
densities, more like in pp or pA collisions. We present calculations which
allow to separate these two contributions, and which show that the corona
contribution is quite small (but not negligible) for central collisions, but
gets increasingly important with decreasing centrality. We will discuss
consequences concerning results obtained in heavy ion collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

"Dynamics of shear homeomorphisms of tori and the Bestvina-Handel
  algorithm",Tali Pinsky and Bronislaw Wajnryb,"  Sharkovskii proved that the existence of a periodic orbit in a
one-dimensional dynamical system implies existence of infinitely many periodic
orbits. We obtain an analog of Sharkovskii's theorem for periodic orbits of
shear homeomorphisms of the torus. This is done by obtaining a dynamical order
relation on the set of simple orbits and simple pairs. We then use this order
relation for a global analysis for a quantum chaotic physical system called the
kicked accelerated particle.

Coniveau over $p$-adic fields and points over finite fields,H\'el\`ene Esnault,"  If the $\ell$-adic cohomology of a projective smooth variety, defined over a
$\frak{p}$-adic field $K$ with finite residue field $k$, is supported in
codimension $\ge 1$, then any model over the ring of integers of $K$ has a
$k$-rational point. This slightly improves our earlier result math/0405318: we
needed there the model to be regular (but then our result was more general: we
obtained a congruence for the number of points, and $K$ could be local of
characteristic $p>0$).

Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization,David H. Wolpert and Dev G. Rajnarayan,"  This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

"On the Structure and Properties of Differentially Rotating Main-Sequence
  Stars in the 1-2 M_sun Range","K. B. MacGregor, Stephen Jackson, Andrew Skumanich, T. S. Metcalfe","  We conduct a systematic examination of the properties of models for
chemically homogeneous, differentially rotating, main-sequence stars of mass
1-2 M_sun. The models were constructed using a code based on a reformulation of
the self-consistent field method of computing the equilibrium stellar structure
for a specified conservative internal rotation law. [abridged] Relative to
nonrotating stars of the same mass, these models all have reduced luminosities
and effective temperatures, and flattened photospheric shapes (i.e., decreased
polar radii) with equatorial radii that can be larger or smaller, depending on
the degree of differential rotation. For a fixed ratio of the axial rotation
rate to the surface equatorial rotation rate, increasingly rapid rotation
generally deepens convective envelopes, shrinks convective cores, and can lead
to the presence of a convective core (envelope) in a 1 M_sun (2 M_sun) model, a
feature that is absent in a nonrotating star of the same mass. The positions of
differentially rotating models for a given mass M in the H-R diagram can be
shifted in such a way as to approximate the nonrotating ZAMS over ranges in
luminosity and effective temperature that correspond to a mass interval between
M and about 0.7 M. We briefly note a few of the implications of these results,
including (i) possible ambiguities arising from similarities between the
properties of rotating and nonrotating models of different masses, (ii) a
reduced radiative luminosity for a young, rapidly rotating Sun, (iii) the
nuclear destruction of lithium and other light metallic species in the layers
beneath an outer convective envelope, and (iv), the excitation of solar-like
oscillations and the operation of a solar-like hydromagnetic dynamo in some
1.5-2 M_sun stars.

large amplitude of the SDSS J1021 outburst of 7m, superhumps with a period
below the ''period gap'', rebrightening during the declining stage of
superoutburst, rarity of outbursts and obtained spectrum allow to classify this

Discrete phase space and minimum-uncertainty states,William K. Wootters and Daniel M. Sussman,"  The quantum state of a system of qubits can be represented by a Wigner
function on a discrete phase space, each axis of the phase space taking values
in a finite field. Within this framework, we show that one can make sense of
the notion of a ""rotationally invariant state"" of any collection of qubits, and
that any such state is, in a well defined sense, a state of minimum
uncertainty.
"
Turbulent Mixing in the Surface Layers of Accreting Neutron Stars,"Anthony L. Piro (KITP, UCB), Lars Bildsten (KITP)","  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is
transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

The Galactic Center,"R. Genzel, V. Karas","  In the past decade high resolution measurements in the infrared employing
adaptive optics imaging on 10m telescopes have allowed determining the three
dimensional orbits stars within ten light hours of the compact radio source at
the center of the Milky Way. These observations show the presence of a three
million solar mass black hole in Sagittarius A* beyond any reasonable doubt.
The Galactic Center thus constitutes the best astrophysical evidence for the
existence of black holes which have long been postulated, and is also an ideal
`lab' for studying the physics in the vicinity of such an object. Remarkably,
young massive stars are present there and probably have formed in the innermost
stellar cusp. Variable infrared and X-ray emission from Sagittarius A* are a
new probe of the physical processes and space-time curvature just outside the
event horizon.

"A geometric proof that $e$ is irrational and a new measure of its
  irrationality",Jonathan Sondow,"  We give a simple geometric proof that $e$ is irrational, using a construction
of a nested sequence of closed intervals with intersection $e$. The proof leads
to a new measure of irrationality for $e$: if $p$ and $q$ are integers with $q
> 1$, then $|e - p/q| > 1/(S(q)+1)!$, where $S(q)$ is the smallest positive
integer such that $S(q)!$ is a multiple of $q$. We relate this measure for $e$
to a known one and to the greatest prime factor of an integer. We make two
conjectures and recall a theorem of Cantor that can be proved by a similar
construction.

Scanning tunnelling microscopy for ultracold atoms,"Corinna Kollath, Michael K\""ohl, Thierry Giamarchi","  We propose a novel experimental probe for cold atomic gases analogous to the

dependence of lattice modulations on the contrary show a completely different
picture. Whereas in TbMnO3 the polarization flop from P||c to P||a is
accompanied by a sudden change from incommensurate to commensurate wave vector
modulation, in DyMnO3 the wave vector varies continuously through the flop
transition. This smooth behavior may be related to the giant magnetocapacitive
effect observed in DyMnO3.

the thermal effects. The temperature and the contaminant's concentration
fulfill convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The velocity and the pressure
in the flow satisfy the Darcy equation, with a viscosity depending on both

coupled. Using both finite volume and nonconforming finite element methods, we
introduce a scheme adapted to this problem. We prove the stability and
convergence of this scheme and give some error estimates.

Realizable Hamiltonians for Universal Adiabatic Quantum Computers,Jacob D. Biamonte and Peter J. Love,"  It has been established that local lattice spin Hamiltonians can be used for
universal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model
Hamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types
of interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present
paper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to
experimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic
quantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known
QMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local
transverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is
perhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for
adiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered
universal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.
We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only
1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.

described in terms of the wurtzite atomic structure with extensive stacking
faults. The density of faults in the nanoparticles ~50% . The diameter of the
core region was extracted directly from the PDF data and is in good agreement
with the diameter obtained from standard characterization methods suggesting
that there is little surface amorphous region. A compressive strain was
measured in the Cd-Se bond length that increases with decreasing particle size
being 0.5% with respect to bulk CdSe for the 2 nm diameter particles. This
study demonstrates the size-dependent quantitative structural information that
can be obtained even from very small nanoparticles using the PDF approach.

Brane-world Quantum Gravity,"M. D. Maia, Nildsen Silva and M.C.B. Fernandes","  The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner canonical formulation of general relativity is
extended to the covariant brane-world theory in arbitrary dimensions. The
exclusive probing of the extra dimensions makes a substantial difference,
allowing for the construction of a non-constrained canonical theory. The
quantum states of the brane-world geometry are defined by the
Tomonaga-Schwinger equation, whose integrability conditions are determined by
the classical perturbations of submanifolds contained in the Nash's
differentiable embedding theorem. In principle, quantum brane-world theory can

experiments at Tev energy. The implications to the black-hole information loss
problem, to the accelerating cosmology, and to a quantum mathematical theory of
four-sub manifolds are briefly commented.

Isospin diffusion in thermal AdS/CFT with flavor,"Johanna Erdmenger, Matthias Kaminski, Felix Rust","  We study the gauge/gravity dual of a finite temperature field theory at
finite isospin chemical potential by considering a probe of two coincident
D7-branes embedded in the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. The isospin
chemical potential is obtained by giving a vev to the time component of the
non-Abelian gauge field on the brane. The fluctuations of the non-Abelian gauge
field on the brane are dual to the SU(2) flavor current in the field theory.
For the embedding corresponding to vanishing quark mass, we calculate all Green
functions corresponding to the components of the flavor current correlator. We
discuss the physical properties of these Green functions, which go beyond
linear response theory. In particular, we show that the isospin chemical
potential leads to a frequency-dependent isospin diffusion coefficient.

Projective Hilbert space structures at exceptional points,"Uwe Guenther, Ingrid Rotter, Boris F. Samsonov","  A non-Hermitian complex symmetric 2x2 matrix toy model is used to study
projective Hilbert space structures in the vicinity of exceptional points
(EPs). The bi-orthogonal eigenvectors of a diagonalizable matrix are
Puiseux-expanded in terms of the root vectors at the EP. It is shown that the
apparent contradiction between the two incompatible normalization conditions
with finite and singular behavior in the EP-limit can be resolved by
projectively extending the original Hilbert space. The complementary
normalization conditions correspond then to two different affine charts of this
enlarged projective Hilbert space. Geometric phase and phase jump behavior are
analyzed and the usefulness of the phase rigidity as measure for the distance
to EP configurations is demonstrated. Finally, EP-related aspects of
PT-symmetrically extended Quantum Mechanics are discussed and a conjecture
concerning the quantum brachistochrone problem is formulated.

Excitation of the dissipationless Higgs mode in a fermionic condensate,"R. A. Barankov, L. S. Levitov","  The amplitude mode of a fermionic superfluid, analogous to the Higgs Boson,
becomes undamped in the strong coupling regime when its frequency is pushed
inside the BCS energy gap. We argue that this is the case in cold gases due to
the energy dispersion and nonlocality of the pairing interaction, and propose
to use the Feshbach resonance regime for parametric excitation of this mode.
The results presented for the BCS pairing dynamics indicate that even weak
dispersion suppresses dephasing and gives rise to persistent oscillations. The
frequency of oscillations extracted from our simulation of the BCS dynamics
agrees with the prediction of the many-body theory.

"A Disciplined Approach to Adopting Agile Practices: The Agile Adoption
  Framework","Ahmed Sidky, James Arthur, Shawn Bohner","  Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the
numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include,
but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality,
and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured
process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting
agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption
Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement
index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption
efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is
used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage
process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations
are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of
agile practices can and should be introduced.

Mg10Ir19B16 was calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Electronic
part of the electron-phonon coupling constant, McMillan-Hopfield parameters,
were calculated using the rigid-muffin-tin approximation (RMTA). The magnitude
of the electron-phonon coupling constant, analysing atomic contributions, is

Prospects of using simulations to study the photospheres of brown dwarfs,Hans-G. Ludwig,"  We discuss prospects of using multi-dimensional time-dependent simulations to
study the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets, including
the processes of convection, radiation, dust formation, and rotation. We argue
that reasonably realistic simulations are feasible, however, separated into two
classes of local and global models. Numerical challenges are related to
potentially large dynamic ranges, and the treatment of scattering of radiation
in multi-D geometries.

  and N. Gehrels","  We present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal analysis of Swift
and XMM-Newton observations of the high redshift (z=3.969) GRB 050730. The
X-ray afterglow of GRB 050730 was found to decline with time with superimposed
intense flaring activity that extended over more than two orders of magnitude
in time. Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ks
after the burst were observed. The underlying decay of the afterglow was well
described by a double broken power-law model with breaks at t_1= 237 +/- 20 s
and t_2 = 10.1 (-2.2) (+4.6) ks. The temporal decay slopes before, between and
after these breaks were alpha_1 = 2.1 +/- 0.3, alpha_2 = 0.44 (-0.08) (+0.14)
and alpha_3 = 2.40 (+0.07) (-0.09), respectively. The spectrum of the X-ray
afterglow was well described by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with an
absorbing column density N_H=(1.28 +/- 0.26) 10^22 cm^-2 in the host galaxy.
Strong X-ray spectral evolution during the flaring activity was present. In the
majority of the flares (6/7) the ratio Delta_t/t_p between the duration of the
event and the time when the flare peaks was nearly constant and about 0.6-0.7.
We showed that the observed spectral and temporal properties of the first three
flares are consistent with being due both to high-latitude emission, as
expected if the flares were produced by late internal shocks, or to refreshed
shocks, i.e. late time energy injections into the main afterglow shock by slow
moving shells ejected from the central engine during the prompt phase. The
event fully satisfies the E_p-E_iso Amati relation while is not consistent with
the E_p-E_jet Ghirlanda relation.

IRAS 18317-0757: A Cluster of Embedded Massive Stars and Protostars,"T.R. Hunter, Q. Zhang, T.K. Sridharan","  We present high-resolution, multiwavelength continuum and molecular-line
images of the massive star forming region IRAS 18317-0757. The IR through mm
spectral energy distribution can be approximated by a two-temperature model (25
and 63 K) with a total luminosity of approximately log(L/Lsun)=5.2. Previous
submm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of which
is associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.
In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, with
total flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLA
cm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and in
the MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperature
of 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish and
interferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O cores
in this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. While
the overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaks
do not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by
2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Two
stars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as O
stars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have no
obvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, our
observations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloud
has taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the O
stars to become detectable at IR wavelengths. Additional star formation appears
to be ongoing on the periphery of the central region, where up to four B-type
(proto)stars have formed among a substantial number of C18O molecular cores.

Photometry of the SW Sex-type nova-like BH Lyncis in high state,"V. Stanishev, Z. Kraicheva, V. Genkov","  Aims: We present a photometric study of the deeply eclipsing SW Sex-type
nova-like cataclysmic variable star BH Lyn
  Methods: Time-resolved V-band CCD photometry was obtained for seven nights
between 1999 and 2004.
  Results: We determined 11 new eclipse timings of BH Lyn and derived a refined
orbital ephemeris with an orbital period of 0.155875577(14) day. During the
observations, BH Lyn was in high-state with V~15.5 mag. The star presents ~1.5
mag deep eclipses with mean full-width at half-flux of 0.0683(+/-0.0054)P_orb.
  The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. This
is most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distribution
variations, most probably caused by strong flickering. Time-dependent accretion
disc self-occultation or variations of the hot spot(s) intensity are also
possible explanations. Negative superhumps with period of ~0.145 day are
detected in two long runs in 2000. A possible connection between SW Sex and
negative superhump phenomena through the presence of tilted accretion disc is
discussed, and a way to observationally test this is suggested.

The Reverse Shock of SNR 1987A,Kevin Heng,"  The reverse shock of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A emits in H-alpha and
Ly-alpha, and comes in two flavors: surface and interior. The former is due to
direct, impact excitation of hydrogen atoms crossing the shock, while the
latter is the result of charge transfer reactions between these atoms and
slower, post-shock ions. Interior and surface emission are analogous to the
broad- and narrow-line components observed in Balmer-dominated SNRs. I
summarize a formalism to derive line intensities and ratios in these SNRs, as
well as a study of the transition zone in supernova shocks; I include an
appendix where I derive in detail the ratio of broad to narrow H-alpha
emission. Further study of the reverse shock emission from SNR 1987A will allow
us to predict when it will vanish and further investigate the origins of the
interior emission.

"3.8-Micron Photometry During the Secondary Eclipse of the Extrasolar
  Planet HD 209458b","Drake Deming, L. Jeremy Richardson, and Joseph Harrington","  We report infrared photometry of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b during the
time of secondary eclipse (planet passing behind the star). Observations were
acquired during two secondary eclipses at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility
(IRTF) in September 2003. We used a circular variable filter (1.5-percent
bandpass) centered at 3.8 microns to isolate the predicted flux peak of the
planet at this wavelength. Residual telluric absorption and instrument
variations were removed by offsetting the telescope to nearby bright comparison
stars at a high temporal cadence. Our results give a secondary eclipse depth of
0.0013 +/- 0.0011, not yet sufficient precision to detect the eclipse, whose
expected depth is approximately 0.002 - 0.003. We here elucidate the current
observational limitations to this technique, and discuss the approach needed to
achieve detections of hot Jupiter secondary eclipses at 3.8 microns from the
ground.

Ke4 decays and Wigner cusp,L. Masetti,"  The NA48/2 experiment at the CERN SPS collected in 2003 and 2004 large
samples of the decays K+- -> pi+ pi- e+- nu (Ke4+-), K+- -> pi0 pi0 e+- nu
(Ke400) and K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+-. From the Ke4+- form factors and from the cusp
in the M00^2 distribution of the K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+- events, the pi-pi
scattering lengths a00 and a20 could be extracted. This measurement is a
fundamental test of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). The branching fraction
and form factors of the Ke400 decay were precisely measured, using a much
larger data sample than in previous experiments. An improved measurement of the
slope parameters for the decay K+- -> pi0 pi0 pi+- showed evidence for a
non-zero value of k.

Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel,Nihar Jindal,"  A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is
available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel
(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to
transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter
has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel
feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining
because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization
of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to
quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user
selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

Colliding Branes and Formation of Spacetime Singularities,Andreas Tziolas and Anzhong Wang,"  We construct a class of analytic solutions with two free parameters to the

collision, due to the mutual focus of the two branes. Non-singular spacetime
can be constructed only in the case where both of the two branes violate the
energy conditions.

"Hitting probabilities for systems of non-linear stochastic heat
  equations with multiplicative noise","Robert C. Dalang, Davar Khoshnevisan, and Eulalia Nualart","  We consider a system of d non-linear stochastic heat equations in spatial
dimension 1 driven by d-dimensional space-time white noise. The non-linearities
appear both as additive drift terms and as multipliers of the noise. Using
techniques of Malliavin calculus, we establish upper and lower bounds on the
one-point density of the solution u(t,x), and upper bounds of Gaussian-type on
the two-point density of (u(s,y),u(t,x)). In particular, this estimate
quantifies how this density degenerates as (s,y) converges to (t,x). From these
results, we deduce upper and lower bounds on hitting probabilities of the
process {u(t,x)}_{t \in \mathbb{R}_+, x \in [0,1]}, in terms of respectively
Hausdorff measure and Newtonian capacity. These estimates make it possible to
show that points are polar when d >6 and are not polar when d<6. We also show
that the Hausdorff dimension of the range of the process is 6 when d>6, and
give analogous results for the processes t \mapsto u(t,x) and x \mapsto u(t,x).
Finally, we obtain the values of the Hausdorff dimensions of the level sets of
these processes.

Mutant knots and intersection graphs,"S.V.Chmutov, S.K.Lando","  We prove that if a finite order knot invariant does not distinguish mutant

  Arnal","  We present CaII K and TiII optical spectra of early-type stars taken mainly
from the UVES Paranal Observatory Project, plus HI 21-cm spectra from the
Vila-Elisa and Leiden-Dwingeloo surveys, which are employed to obtain distances
to intermediate and high velocity clouds. HI emission at a velocity of -117
km/s towards the sightline HD 30677 with NHI=1.7x10^19 cm-2 has no
corresponding CaII K absorption, which has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of
610. The star has a spectroscopically determined distance of 2.7-kpc, and hence
sets this as a firm lower distance limit towards Anti-Centre cloud ACII.
Towards another sightline (HD 46185), HI at +122 km/s and NHI=1.2x10^19 cm-2 is
seen. The CaII K spectrum has a S/N = 780, although no absorption is observed
at the cloud velocity. This similarly places a firm lower distance limit of
2.9-kpc towards this parcel of gas that may be an intermediate velocity cloud.
The lack of intermediate velocity (IV) CaII K absorption towards HD 196426 at a
S/N = 500 reinforces a lower distance limit of 700-pc towards this part of
Complex gp, where NHI is 1.1x10^19 cm-2 and velocity is +78 km/s. Additionally,
no IV CaII K is seen in absorption in the spectrum of HD 19445, which is strong
in HI with NHI=8x10^19 cm-2 at -42 km/s, placing a firm although uninteresting
lower distance limit of 39-pc to this part of IV South. Finally, no HV CaII K
absorption is seen towards HD 115363 at a S/N = 410, placing a lower distance
of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC gas at velocity of +224 km/s and NHI=5.2x10^19 cm-2.
This gas is in the same region of the sky as complex WE (Wakker 2001), but at
higher velocities. The non-detection of CaII K absorption sets a lower distance
of 3.2-kpc towards the HVC, which is unsurprising if this feature is indeed
related to the Magellanic System.

Physisorption of Nucleobases on Graphene,"S. Gowtham, Ralph H. Scheicher, Rajeev Ahuja, Ravindra Pandey, Shashi

interaction of the nucleobases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine
(T), and uracil (U) with graphene, carried out within the density functional
theory framework, with additional calculations utilizing Hartree--Fock plus
second-order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory. The calculated binding energy
of the nucleobases shows the following hierarchy: G > T ~ C ~ A > U, with the
equilibrium configuration being very similar for all five of them. Our results
clearly demonstrate that the nucleobases exhibit significantly different
interaction strengths when physisorbed on graphene. The stabilizing factor in
the interaction between the base molecule and graphene sheet is dominated by
the molecular polarizability that allows a weakly attractive dispersion force
to be induced between them. The present study represents a significant step
towards a first-principles understanding of how the base sequence of DNA can
affect its interaction with carbon nanotubes, as observed experimentally.

Low Density Lattice Codes,"Naftali Sommer, Meir Feder and Ofir Shalvi","  Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded
efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise

Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message
vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse.
The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative
decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error
performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols.
The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.

covering the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy, the Southern quadrant out to 150 kpc,
and extending to M33. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very
outermost region of galaxies. We detect several streams and other large-scale
structures, and two new dwarf galaxies: And XV and XVI. The discovery of
substructure on the minor axis, together with the fact that the light profile
between 0.5 < R < 1.3 follows the exponential ``extended disk'', is
particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting
results reported in previous studies. Underlying the substructures lies a
faint, metal-poor, smooth and extremely extended halo, reaching out to at least
150 kpc. The smooth halo component in M31 has a profile that can be fit with a
Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost a factor of 4 larger
than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power-law with exponent -1.91 +/-
0.11 can be fit to the profile. The total luminosity of this structure is
similar to that of the halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying
halo is reminiscent of a classical monolithic model and completely unexpected
from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended
metal-poor halo component, which can be fit with a Hernquist model also of
scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly-decreasing halos will provide a
challenge and strong constraints for further modeling. [Abridged]

"Using conceptual metaphor and functional grammar to explore how language
  used in physics affects student learning","David T. Brookes, Eugenia Etkina","  This paper introduces a theory about the role of language in learning
physics. The theory is developed in the context of physics students' and
physicists' talking and writing about the subject of quantum mechanics. We
found that physicists' language encodes different varieties of analogical
models through the use of grammar and conceptual metaphor. We hypothesize that
students categorize concepts into ontological categories based on the
grammatical structure of physicists' language. We also hypothesize that
students over-extend and misapply conceptual metaphors in physicists' speech
and writing. Using our theory, we will show how, in some cases, we can explain
student difficulties in quantum mechanics as difficulties with language.

Supersymmetry versus Gauge Symmetry on the Heterotic Landscape,"Keith R. Dienes, Michael Lennek, David S\'en\'echal, Vaibhav Wasnik","  One of the goals of the landscape program in string theory is to extract
information about the space of string vacua in the form of statistical
correlations between phenomenological features that are otherwise uncorrelated
in field theory. Such correlations would thus represent predictions of string
theory that hold independently of a vacuum-selection principle. In this paper,
we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to be
central to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gauge
symmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between these
two kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic string
vacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that the
degree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilities
of realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the string
scale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank. We also find that
nearly half of the heterotic landscape is non-supersymmetric and yet
tachyon-free at tree level; indeed, less than a quarter of the tree-level
heterotic landscape exhibits any supersymmetry at all at the string scale.

Multi-Higgs U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory in Three Dimensions,"Tomoyoshi Ono, Ikuo Ichinose, Tetsuo Matsui","  We study the three-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory with $N$
Higgs fields numerically. This model is relevant to multi-component
superconductors, antiferromagnetic spin systems in easy plane, inflational
cosmology, etc. For N=2, the system has a second-order phase transition line
$\tilde{c}_1(c_2)$ in the $c_2$(gauge coupling)$-c_1$(Higgs coupling) plane,
which separates the confinement phase and the Higgs phase. For N=3, the
critical line is separated into two parts; one for $c_2 \alt 2.25$ with
first-order transitions, and the other for $c_2 \agt 2.25$ with second-order
transitions.

Identifying Dark Matter Burners in the Galactic center,"Igor V. Moskalenko (Stanford), Lawrence L. Wai (SLAC)","  If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of our Galaxy grew
adiabatically, then a dense ""spike"" of dark matter is expected to have formed
around it. Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBH
can capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due to
annihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or even
exceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thus
predicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. ""WIMP burners"", in the vicinity
of an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burners
are stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degenerate
cores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for the
existence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish its
density profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMP
burning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate core
masses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with the
observed stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could be
consistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. We
also cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux of
gamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the dark
matter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that the
EGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precision
measurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matter
spike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringent
limits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.

Instabilities in the time-dependent neutrino disc in Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Agnieszka Janiuk, Ye-Fei Yuan, Rosalba Perna, Tiziana di Matteo","  We investigate the properties and evolution of accretion tori formed after
the coalescence of two compact objects. At these extreme densities and
temperatures, the accreting torus is cooled mainly by neutrino emission
produced primarily by electron and positron capture on nucleons (beta
reactions). We solve for the disc structure and its time evolution by
introducing a detailed treatment of the equation of state which includes
photodisintegration of helium, the condition of beta-equilibrium, and neutrino
opacities. We self-consistently calculate the chemical equilibrium in the gas
consisting of helium, free protons, neutrons and electron-positron pairs and
compute the chemical potentials of the species, as well as the electron
fraction throughout the disc. We find that, for sufficiently large accretion
rates (> 10 solar masses per second), the inner regions of the disk become
opaque and develop a viscous and thermal instability. The identification of
this instability might be relevant for GRB observations.
"
Complete integrable systems with unconfined singularities,Victor Manosa,"  We prove that any globally periodic rational discrete system in K^k(where K
denotes either R or C), has unconfined singularities, zero algebraic entropy
and it is complete integrable (that is, it has as many functionally independent
first integrals as the dimension of the phase space). In fact, for some of
these systems the unconfined singularities are the key to obtain first
integrals using the Darboux-type method of integrability.

On the largest prime factor of the Mersenne numbers,"Kevin Ford, Florian Luca, Igor E. Shparlinski","  Let P(k) be the largest prime factor of the positive integer k. In this

"Developing the Galactic diffuse emission model for the GLAST Large Area
  Telescope","Igor V. Moskalenko (Stanford), Andrew W. Strong (MPE), Seth W. Digel
  (SLAC), Troy A. Porter (UCSC)","  Diffuse emission is produced in energetic cosmic ray (CR) interactions,
mainly protons and electrons, with the interstellar gas and radiation field and
contains the information about particle spectra in distant regions of the
Galaxy. It may also contain information about exotic processes such as dark
matter annihilation, black hole evaporation etc. A model of the diffuse
emission is important for determination of the source positions and spectra.
Calculation of the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission requires a
model for CR propagation as the first step. Such a model is based on theory of
particle transport in the interstellar medium as well as on many kinds of data
provided by different experiments in Astrophysics and Particle and Nuclear
Physics. Such data include: secondary particle and isotopic production cross
sections, total interaction nuclear cross sections and lifetimes of radioactive
species, gas mass calibrations and gas distribution in the Galaxy (H_2, H I, H
II), interstellar radiation field, CR source distribution and particle spectra
at the sources, magnetic field, energy losses, gamma-ray and synchrotron
production mechanisms, and many other issues. We are continuously improving the
GALPROP model and the code to keep up with a flow of new data. Improvement in
any field may affect the Galactic diffuse continuum gamma-ray emission model
used as a background model by the GLAST LAT instrument. Here we report about
the latest improvements of the GALPROP and the diffuse emission model.

Prompt Emission of High Energy Photons from Gamma Ray Bursts,Nayantara Gupta and Bing Zhang,"  Within the internal shock scenario we consider different mechanisms of high
energy ($>1$ MeV) photon production inside a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fireball and
derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the
prompt phase. The photon spectra of leptonic and hadronic origins are compared
within different sets of parameter regimes. Our results suggest that the high
energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux
level is however too low to be detected by current TeV detectors, and these
photons also suffer attenuation by external soft photons.

On the classification of Floer-type theories,Nadya Shirokova,"  In this paper we outline a program for the classification of Floer-type
theories, (or defining invariants of finite type for families). We consider
Khovanov complexes as a local system on the space of knots introduced by V.
Vassiliev and construct the wall-crossing morphism. We extend this system to
the singular locus by the cone of this morphism and introduce the definition of
the local system of finite type. This program can be further generalized to the
manifolds of dimension 3 and 4.

"On the reductive Borel-Serre compactification: $L^p$-cohomology of
  arithmetic groups (for large $p$)",Steven Zucker,"  The $L^2$-cohomology of a locally symmetric variety is known to have the
topological interpretation as the intersection homology of its Baily-Borel
Satake compactification. In this article, we observe that even without the
Hermitian hypothesis, the $L^p$-cohomology of an arithmetic quotient, for $p$
finite and sufficiently large, is isomorphic to the ordinary cohomology of its
reductive Borel-Serre compactification. We use this to generalize a theorem of
Mumford concerning homogeneous vector bundles, their invariant Chern forms and
the canonical extensions of the bundles; here, though, we are referring to
canonical extensions to the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of any
arithmetic quotient. To achieve that, we give a systematic discussion of vector
bundles and Chern classes on stratified

"The $^4$He total photo-absorption cross section with two- plus
  three-nucleon interactions from chiral effective field theory",S. Quaglioni and P. Navratil,"  The total photo-absorption cross section of $^4$He is evaluated
microscopically using two- (NN) and three-nucleon (NNN) interactions based upon
chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT). The calculation is performed using
the Lorentz integral transform method along with the {\em ab initio} no-core
shell model approach. An important feature of the present study is the
consistency of the NN and NNN interactions and also, through the Siegert
theorem, of the two- and three-body current operators. This is due to the
application of the $\chi$EFT framework. The inclusion of the NNN interaction
produces a suppression of the low-energy peak and enhancement of the
high-energy tail of the cross section. We compare to calculations obtained
using other interactions and to representative experiments. The rather confused
experimental situation in the giant resonance region prevents discrimination
among different interaction models.

"True and Apparent Scaling: The Proximity of the Markov-Switching
  Multifractal Model to Long-Range Dependence","Ruipeng Liu, T. Di Matteo, Thomas Lux","  In this paper, we consider daily financial data of a collection of different
stock market indices, exchange rates, and interest rates, and we analyze their
multi-scaling properties by estimating a simple specification of the
Markov-switching multifractal model (MSM). In order to see how well the
estimated models capture the temporal dependence of the data, we estimate and
compare the scaling exponents $H(q)$ (for $q = 1, 2$) for both empirical data
and simulated data of the estimated MSM models. In most cases the multifractal
model appears to generate `apparent' long memory in agreement with the
empirical scaling laws.

counting scheme. The relation between our results and an alternative counting
scheme, the momentum counting scheme, is also discussed.

"Hardy and Rellich type inequalities with remainders for Baouendi-Grushin
  vector fields",Ismail Kombe,"  In this paper we study Hardy and Rellich type inequalities for
Baouendi-Grushin vector fields : $\nabla_{\gamma}=(\nabla_x,
|x|^{2\gamma}\nabla_y)$ where $\gamma>0$, $\nabla_x$ and $\nabla_y$ are usual
gradient operators in the variables $x\in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $y\in\mathbb{R}^k$,
respectively. In the first part of the paper, we prove some weighted Hardy type
inequalities with remainder terms. In the second part, we prove two versions of
weighted Rellich type inequality on the whole space. We find sharp constants
for these inequalities. We also obtain their improved versions for bounded
domains.
"
Resummation Effects in the Search of SM Higgs Boson at Hadron Colliders,Qing-Hong Cao and Chuan-Ren Chen,"  We examine the soft-gluon resummation effects, including the exact spin
correlations among the final state particles, in the search of the Standard
Model Higgs boson, via the process $gg\to H\to WW/ZZ \to 4 leptons, at the
Tevatron and the LHC. A comparison between the resummation and the
Next-to-Leading order (NLO) calculation is performed after imposing various
kinematics cuts suggested in the literature for the Higgs boson search. For the
$H\to ZZ$ mode, the resummation effects increase the acceptance of the signal
events by about 25%, as compared to the NLO prediction, and dramatically alter
various kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\to WW$
mode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummation
and NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematical
distributions are quite different. Thus, to precisely determine the properties
of the Higgs boson at hadron colliders, the soft-gluon resummation effects have
to be taken into account.

Triquark structure and isospin symmetry breaking in exotic Ds mesons,S. Yasui and M. Oka,"  The color anti-triplet triquark $q\bar{q}\bar{q}$ is considered as a compact
component in the tetraquark structure $cq\bar{q}\bar{q}$ of exotic $D_{s}$
mesons. We discuss the mass spectrum and the flavor mixing of the triquarks by
using the instanton induced interaction and the one-gluon exchange potentials.
As a characteristic property of the triquark, we investigate the isospin
violation. It is shown that the flavor $\bar{\bf 3}$ (isosinglet) and $\bf 6$
(isotriplet) states may be strongly mixed and then are identified with
$D_{s}(2632)$.

Prediction of future fifteen solar cycles,K. M. Hiremath,"  In the previous study (Hiremath 2006a), the solar cycle is modeled as a
forced and damped harmonic oscillator and from all the 22 cycles (1755-1996),
long-term amplitudes, frequencies, phases and decay factor are obtained. Using
these physical parameters of the previous 22 solar cycles and by an {\em
autoregressive model}, we predict the amplitude and period of the future
fifteen solar cycles. Predicted amplitude of the present solar cycle (23)
matches very well with the observations. The period of the present cycle is
found to be 11.73 years. With these encouraging results, we also predict the
profiles of future 15 solar cycles. Important predictions are : (i) the period
and amplitude of the cycle 24 are 9.34 years and 110 ($\pm 11$), (ii) the
period and amplitude of the cycle 25 are 12.49 years and 110 ($\pm$ 11), (iii)

(2152-2163 AD) and 38 (2163-2176 AD), the sun might experience a very high
sunspot activity, (iv) the sun might also experience a very low (around 60)
sunspot activity during cycle 31 (2089-2100 AD) and, (v) length of the solar
cycles vary from 8.65 yrs for the cycle 33 to maximum of 13.07 yrs for the
cycle 35.

Rigidly rotating dust solutions depending upon harmonic functions,Stefano Viaggiu,"  We write down the relevant field equations for a stationary axially symmetric
rigidly rotating dust source in such a way that the general solution depends

with the dipole Bonnor solution, we built an asymptotically flat solution with
two curvature singularities on the rotational axis with diverging mass. Apart
from the two point singularities on the axis, the metric is regular everywhere.
Finally, we study a non-asymptotically flat solution with NUT charge and a
massless ring singularity, but with a well-defined mass-energy expression.

"Lowest Landau Level of Relativistic Field Theories in a Strong
  Background Field",Xavier Calmet and Martin Kober,"  We consider gauge theories in a strong external magnetic like field. This
situation can appear either in conventional four-dimensional theories, but also
naturally in extra-dimensional theories and especially in brane world models.
We show that in the lowest Landau level approximation, some of the coordinates
become non-commutative. We find physical reasons to formal problems with
non-commutative gauge theories such as the issue with SU(N) gauge symmetries.
Our construction is applied to a minimal extension of the standard model. It is
shown that the Higgs sector might be non-commutative whereas the remaining
sectors of the standard model remain commutative. Signatures of this model at
the LHC are discussed. We then discuss an application to a dark matter sector
coupled to the Higgs sector of the standard model and show that here again,
dark matter could be non-commutative, the standard model fields remaining
commutative.

"Mechanical and dielectric relaxation spectra in seven highly viscous
  glass formers",U. Buchenau,"  Published dielectric and shear data of six molecular glass formers and one
polymer are evaluated in terms of a spectrum of thermally activated processes,
with the same barrier density for the retardation spectrum of shear and
dielectrics. The viscosity, an independent parameter of the fit, seems to be
related to the high-barrier cutoff time of the dielectric signal, in accordance
with the idea of a renewal of the relaxing entities after this critical time.
In the five cases where one can fit accurately, the temperature dependence of
the high-barrier cutoff follows the shoving model. The Johari-Goldstein peaks,
seen in four of our seven cases, are describable in terms of gaussians in the
barrier density, superimposed on the high-frequency tail of the
$\alpha$-process. Dielectric and shear measurements of the same substance find
the same peak positions and widths of these gaussians, but in general a
different weight.

"Computational and experimental imaging of Mn defects on GaAs (110)
  cross-sectional surface","A. Stroppa, X. Duan, M. Peressi, D. Furlanetto, S. Modesti","  We present a combined experimental and computational study of the (110)
cross-sectional surface of Mn $\delta$-doped GaAs samples. We focus our study
on three different selected Mn defect configurations not previously studied in
details, namely surface interstitial Mn, isolated and in pairs, and
substitutional Mn atoms on cationic sites (Mn$_{\rm Ga}$) in the first
subsurface layer. The sensitivity of the STM images to the specific local
environment allows to distinguish between Mn interstitials with nearest
neighbor As atoms (Int$_{\rm As}$) rather than Ga atoms (Int$_{\rm Ga}$), and
to identify the fingerprint of peculiar satellite features around subsurface
substitutional Mn. The simulated STM maps for Int$_{\rm As}$, both isolated and
in pairs, and Mn$_{\rm Ga}$ in the first subsurface layer are consistent with
some experimental images hitherto not fully characterized.

Distance preserving mappings from ternary vectors to permutations,"Jyh-Shyan Lin, Jen-Chun Chang, Rong-Jaye Chen, Torleiv Kl{\o}ve","  Distance-preserving mappings (DPMs) are mappings from the set of all q-ary

we propose a construction of DPMs from ternary vectors. The constructed DPMs
improve the lower bounds on the maximal size of permutation arrays.

Hamiltonian Quantum Dynamics With Separability Constraints,Nikola Buric,"  Schroedinger equation on a Hilbert space ${\cal H}$, represents a linear
Hamiltonian dynamical system on the space of quantum pure states, the
projective Hilbert space $P {\cal H}$. Separable states of a bipartite quantum
system form a special submanifold of $P {\cal H}$.
  We analyze the Hamiltonian dynamics that corresponds to the quantum system
constrained on the manifold of separable states, using as an important example
the system of two interacting qubits. The constraints introduce nonlinearities
which render the dynamics nontrivial. We show that the qualitative properties
of the constrained dynamics clearly manifest the symmetry of the qubits system.
In particular, if the quantum Hamilton's operator has not enough symmetry, the
constrained dynamics is nonintegrable, and displays the typical features of a
Hamiltonian dynamical system with mixed phase space. Possible physical
realizations of the separability constraints are discussed.

Planck Length and Cosmology,Xavier Calmet,"  We show that an unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity
implies that there is a fundamental length in Nature in the sense that no
operational procedure would be able to measure distances shorter than the
Planck length. Furthermore we give an explicit realization of an old proposal
by Anderson and Finkelstein who argued that a fundamental length in nature
implies unimodular gravity. Finally, using hand waving arguments we show that a
minimal length might be related to the cosmological constant which, if this
scenario is realized, is time dependent.

separation, and concatenations of signals in adjacent time frames are resolved
with optimization of $l^1 \times l^\infty$ norm on cross-correlation
coefficients at multiple time lags. The algorithm is a direct method without

Fast recursive filters for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems,J. H. van Hateren,"  A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic
systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by
a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass
filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and
nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system
may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience
are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation
according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly
different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for
feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for
feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal
cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster
than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory
requirements, and is also suited for computation on a stream processor, such as
a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).

CCD BV survey of 42 open clusters,"G. Maciejewski, A. Niedzielski","  We present results of a photometric survey whose aim was to derive structural
and astrophysical parameters for 42 open clusters. While our sample is
definitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,
it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allow
for simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry was
obtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamical
evolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii were
determined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, and
distances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The mass
function was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregation
effect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This study
reports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42
observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observed
clusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.
The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is
3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster's
mass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamical
evolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope is
similar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect of
evaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial mass
segregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas the
dynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.
Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5
and not younger than one relaxation time.

Geometry and Dynamics of Quantum State Diffusion,Nikola Buric,"  Riemannian metric on real 2n-dimensional space associated with the equation
governing complex diffusion of pure states of an open quantum system is
introduced and studied. Examples of a qubit under the influence of dephasing
and thermal environments are used to show that the curvature of the diffusion
metric is a good indicator of the properties of the environment dominated
evolution and its stability.

"Investigation of transit-selected exoplanet candidates from the MACHO
  survey","S. D. Huegelmeyer (1), S. Dreizler (1), D. Homeier (1), A. Reiners
  (1,2) ((1) Institut fuer Astrophysik, Universitaet Goettingen, Germany, (2)
  Hamburger Sternwarte, Universitaet Hamburg, Germany)","  Context: Planets outside our solar system transiting their host star, i. e.
those with an orbital inclination near 90 degree, are of special interest to
derive physical properties of extrasolar planets. With the knowledge of the
host star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.
Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density can
be derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the host
star, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between the
host star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.
  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.
Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transiting
planets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometric
signature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetary
nature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is a
determination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as a
dynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.
  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five stars
selected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits of
low-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means of
cross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been compared
to simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from the
radial velocities and spectral analyses.
  Aims: We show that all transit light curves of the exoplanet candidates
analysed in this work can be explained by eclipses of stellar objects, hence
none of the five transiting objects is a planet.

"On families of rational curves in the Hilbert square of a surface (with
  an Appendix by Edoardo Sernesi)","Flaminio Flamini, Andreas Leopold Knutsen, Gianluca Pacienza, Edoardo
  Sernesi","  Under natural hypotheses we give an upper bound on the dimension of families
of singular curves with hyperelliptic normalizations on a surface S with p_g(S)
>0 via the study of the associated families of rational curves in Hilb^2(S).
  We use this result to prove the existence of nodal curves of geometric genus
3 with hyperelliptic normalizations, on a general K3 surface, thus obtaining
specific 2-dimensional families of rational curves in its Hilbert square. We
describe two infinite series of examples of general, primitively polarized K3's
such that their Hilbert squares contain a IP^2 or a threefold birational to a
IP^1-bundle over a K3.
  We discuss some consequences on the Mori cone of the Hilbert square of a
general K3.

"Anisotropy and Magnetic Field Effects on the Genuine Multipartite
  Entanglement of Multi-Qubit Heisenberg {\it XY} Chains",Chang Chi Kwong and Ye Yeo,"  It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and
magnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite
temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite
critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing
the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit
states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters
concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a
mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this
characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and
magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit
Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model
exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In
addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical
property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses
properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most
importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB
concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of
our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it
is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any
finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

Time dependence of joint entropy of oscillating quantum systems,"O. Ozcan, E. Akturk and R. Sever","  The time dependent entropy (or Leipnik's entropy) of harmonic and damped
harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave

entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time
for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of
the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the

"Tight bound on coherent states quantum key distribution with heterodyne
  detection",Jerome Lodewyck and Philippe Grangier,"  We propose a new upper bound for the eavesdropper's information in the direct
and reverse reconciliated coherent states quantum key distribution protocols
with heterodyne detection. This bound is derived by maximizing the leaked
information over the symplectic group of transformations that spans every
physical Gaussian attack on individual pulses. We exhibit four different
attacks that reach this bound, which shows that this bound is tight. Finally,
we compare the secret key rate obtained with this new bound to the homodyne
rate.

obtained Gaussian upper bound estimates for the heat kernel without imposing
further assumption on the coefficients. We study the fundamental solutions of
the systems of second order parabolic equations in the divergence form with
bounded, measurable, time-independent coefficients, and extend their results to
the systems of parabolic equations.

"A Language-Based Approach for Improving the Robustness of Network
  Application Protocol Implementations","Burgy Laurent (INRIA Futurs), Laurent R\'eveill\`ere (INRIA Futurs),
  Julia Lawall (DIKU), Gilles Muller (INRIA Rennes)","  The secure and robust functioning of a network relies on the defect-free
implementation of network applications. As network protocols have become
increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has
become increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific
language, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing
constraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates
stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to
use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu
is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and
message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,
Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks
specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation
of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and
RTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.

A Close Look at Star Formation around Active Galactic Nuclei,"R. Davies, F. Mueller Sanchez, R. Genzel, L. Tacconi, E. Hicks, S.
  Friedrich, A. Sternberg","  We analyse star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies at spatial
resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than
10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared
adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is
unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the
nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -
starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few
percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the
luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a
similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to
10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density
exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited
and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in
multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset
of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether
this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in
fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and
supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.
On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,
and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

"Decrease of entanglement by local operations in the D\""ur-Cirac method","Yukihiro Ota, Motoyuki Yoshida, Ichiro Ohba","  One cannot always obtain information about entanglement by the D\""ur-Cirac
(DC) method. The impracticality is attributed to the decrease of entanglement
by local operations in the DC method. We show that, even in 2--qubit systems,
there exist states whose entangled property the DC method never evaluates. The
class of such states in 2--qubit systems is completely characterized by the
value of the fully entangled fraction. Actually, a state whose fully entangled
fraction is less than or equal to 1/2 is always transformed into a separable
state by local operations in the DC method, even if it has negative partial
transposition.

mechanism in a quantum phase transition of a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein
condensate, when the applied magnetic field is quenched below a critical value.
It is shown that the magnetic correlation functions have finite correlation
lengths, and magnetizations at widely separated positions grow in random
directions, resulting in spin vortices. We numerically confirm the scaling law
that the winding number of spin vortices is proportional to the square root of
the length of the closed path, and for slow quench, proportional to $\tau_{\rm
Q}^{-1/6}$ with $\tau_{\rm Q}$ being the quench time. The relation between the
spin conservation and the KZ mechanism is discussed.

shall call U-max-statistics. We are concerned with the behavior of the largest
value of such function h instead of its average. Examples of U-max-statistics
are the diameter or the largest scalar product within a random sample.
U-max-statistics of higher degrees are given by triameters and other metric
invariants.

"Mpemba effect and phase transitions in the adiabatic cooling of water

in the adiabatic cooling of water a relevant role is played by supercooling as
well as by phase transitions taking place at 6 +/- 1 oC, 3.5 +/- 0.5 oC and 1.3
+/- 0.6 oC, respectively. The last transition, occurring with a non negligible
probability of 0.21, has not been detected earlier. Supported by the
experimental results achieved, a thorough theoretical analysis of supercooling
and such phase transitions, which are interpreted in terms of different
ordering of clusters of molecules in water, is given.

Effects of atomic interactions on Quantum Accelerator Modes,"Laura Rebuzzini, Roberto Artuso, Shmuel Fishman and Italo Guarneri","  We consider the influence of the inclusion of interatomic interactions on the
delta-kicked accelerator model. Our analysis concerns in particular quantum

The atomic interaction is modelled by a Gross-Pitaevskii cubic nonlinearity,
and we address both attractive (focusing) and repulsive (defocusing) cases. The
most remarkable effect is enhancement or damping of the accelerator modes,
depending on the sign of the nonlinear parameter. We provide arguments showing
that the effect persists beyond mean-field description, and lies within the
experimentally accessible parameter range.

How far is it to a sudden future singularity of pressure?,"Mariusz P. Dabrowski, Tomasz Denkiewicz and Martin A. Hendry","  We discuss the constraints coming from current observations of type Ia
supernovae on cosmological models which allow sudden future singularities of
pressure (with the scale factor and the energy density regular). We show that
such a sudden singularity may happen in the very near future (e.g. within ten
million years) and its prediction at the present moment of cosmic evolution
cannot be distinguished, with current observational data, from the prediction
given by the standard quintessence scenario of future evolution. Fortunately,
sudden future singularities are characterized by a momentary peak of infinite
tidal forces only; there is no geodesic incompletness which means that the
evolution of the universe may eventually be continued throughout until another
``more serious'' singularity such as Big-Crunch or Big-Rip.

Generalizing circles over algebraic extensions,"Tomas Recio, J. Rafael Sendra, Luis Felipe Tabera, Carlos Villarino","  This paper deals with a family of spatial rational curves that were
introduced by Andradas, Recio and Sendra, under the name of hypercircles, as an
algorithmic cornerstone tool in the context of improving the rational
parametrization (simplifying the coefficients of the rational functions, when
possible) of algebraic varieties. A real circle can be defined as the image of
the real axis under a Moebius transformation in the complex field. Likewise,
and roughly speaking, a hypercircle can be defined as the image of a line (""the
${\mathbb{K}}$-axis"") in a $n$-degree finite algebraic extension
$\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\thickapprox\mathbb{K}^n$ under the transformation
$\frac{at+b}{ct+d}:\mathbb{K}(\alpha)\to\mathbb{K}(\alpha)$.
  The aim of this article is to extend, to the case of hypercircles, some of
the specific properties of circles. We show that hypercircles are precisely,
via $\mathbb{K}$-projective transformations, the rational normal curve of a
suitable degree. We also obtain a complete description of the points at
infinity of these curves (generalizing the cyclic structure at infinity of
circles). We characterize hypercircles as those curves of degree equal to the
dimension of the ambient affine space and with infinitely many
${\mathbb{K}}$-rational points, passing through these points at infinity.
Moreover, we give explicit formulae for the parametrization and implicitation
of hypercircles. Besides the intrinsic interest of this very special family of
curves, the understanding of its properties has a direct application to the
simplification of parametrizations problem, as shown in the last section.

"Decreasing families of dynamically determined intervals in the power-law
  family",Waldemar Paluba,"  We study the rate of growth of ratios of intervals delimited by the
post-critical orbit of a map in the quasi-quadratic family $x\mapsto
-|x|^\alpha +a.$ The critical order $\alpha$ is an arbitrary real number
$\alpha>1.$ The range of the parameter $a$ is confined to an interval
$(1,a_{\alpha})$ of length depending on the critical order. We prove that in
every power-law family there is a unique parameter $p_{\alpha}$ corresponding
to the kneading sequence $RLRRRLRC.$ Subsequently, we obtain monotonicity
results concerning ratios of all intervals labeled by infinite post-critical
orbit in the case of the kneading sequence $RLRL...$ This extends the results
from \cite{P}, via refinement of the tools based on special properties of
power-law mappings in non-euclidean metric.

a disordered one-dimensional wire in the Mott insulator regime, are calculated
numerically using the DMRG method. By investigating the influence of the
disorder on the Friedel oscillations decay we find that the effect of disorder
is reduced by increasing the interaction strength. This behavior is opposite to
the recently reported influence of disorder in the Anderson insulator regime,
where disorder led to a stronger decay of the Friedel oscillations.

"Why do some intermediate polars show soft X-ray emission? A survey of
  XMM-Newton spectra","P. A. Evans (Keele University and University of Leicester) and Coel
  Hellier (Keele University)","  We make a systematic analysis of the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra of intermediate
polars (IPs) and find that, contrary to the traditional picture, most show a
soft blackbody component. We compare the results with those from AM Her stars
and deduce that the blackbody emission arises from reprocessing of hard X-rays,
rather than from the blobby accretion sometimes seen in AM Hers. Whether an IP
shows a blackbody component appears to depend primarily on geometric factors: a
blackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always
obscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the
white-dwarf limb. Thus we argue against previous suggestions that the blackbody
emission characterises a separate sub-group of IPs which are more akin to AM
Hers, and develop a unified picture of the blackbody emission in these stars.

able to deal with insulators that escape any mean-field like description, as
for instance non-magnetic insulators. As an application, we study the Mott
transition from a paramagnetic metal into a non-magnetic Peierls, or
valence-bond, Mott insulator. We analyze this model by means of our Gutzwiller
wavefunction analytically in the limit of large coordination lattices, where we
find that: (1) the Mott transition is first order; (2) the Peierls gap is large
in the Mott insulator, although it is mainly contributed by the electron
repulsion; (3) singlet-superconductivity arises around the transition.

Velocity oscillations in actin-based motility,"Azam Gholami, Martin Falcke, Erwin Frey","  We present a simple and generic theoretical description of actin-based

velocity emerge in a broad range of parameter values, and compare our findings
with experiments.

galactic globular cluster NGC1904 (M79). The sample covers the entire cluster
extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the
core. Accordingly, extensive dynamical simulations suggest that BSS formed by
mass transfer activity in primordial binaries evolving in isolation in the
cluster outskirts represent only a negligible (0--10%) fraction of the overall
population.

Higgs and Z' Phenomenology in B-L extension of the Standard Model at LHC,W. Emam and S. Khalil,"  The phenomenology of the low scale U(1)_{B-L} extension of the standard model
and its implications at LHC is presented. In this model, an extra gauge boson
corresponding to B-L gauge symmetry and an extra SM singlet scalar (heavy
Higgs) are predicted. We show a detailed analysis of both heavy and light
Higgses decay and production in addition to the possible decay channels of the
new gauge boson. We find that the cross sections of the SM-like Higgs
production are reduced by ~ 20%-30%, while its decay branching ratios remain
intact. The extra Higgs has relatively small cross sections and the branching
ratios of Z'-> l^+ l^- are of order ~20% compared to ~ 3% of the SM resuls.
Hence, the search for Z' is accessible via a clean dilepton signal at LHC.

What Can be Learned Studying the Distribution of the Biggest Fragment ?,"Eric Bonnet (IPNO, GANIL), Francesca Gulminelli (LPCC), Bernard
  Borderie (IPNO), Nicolas Le Neindre (IPNO), Marie-France Rivet (IPNO)","  In the canonical formalism of statistical physics, a signature of a first
order phase transition for finite systems is the bimodal distribution of an
order parameter. Previous thermodynamical studies of nuclear sources produced
in heavy-ion collisions provide information which support the existence of a
phase transition in those finite nuclear systems. Some results suggest that the
observable Z1 (charge of the biggest fragment) can be considered as a reliable
order parameter of the transition. This talk will show how from peripheral
collisions studied with the INDRA detector at GSI we can obtain this bimodal
behaviour of Z1. Getting rid of the entrance channel effects and under the
constraint of an equiprobable distribution of excitation energy (E*), we use
the canonical description of a phase transition to link this bimodal behaviour
with the residual convexity of the entropy. Theoretical (with and without phase
transition) and experimental Z1-E* correlations are compared. This comparison
allows us to rule out the case without transition. Moreover that quantitative
comparison provides us with information about the coexistence region in the
Z1-E* plane which is in good agreement with that obtained with the signal of
abnormal uctuations of configurational energy (microcanonical negative heat
capacity).

Reconstructing the Intrinsic Triaxial Shape of the Virgo Cluster,"Bomee Lee, Jounghun Lee (Seoul National Univ.)","  To use galaxy clusters as a cosmological probe, it is important to account
for their triaxiality. Assuming that the triaxial shapes of galaxy clusters are
induced by the tidal interaction with the surrounding matter, Lee and Kang
recently developed a reconstruction algorithm for the measurement of the axial
ratio of a triaxial cluster. We examine the validity of this reconstruction
algorithm by performing an observational test of it with the Virgo cluster as a
target. We first modify the LK06 algorithm by incorporating the two dimensional
projection effect. Then, we analyze the 1275 member galaxies from the Virgo
Cluster Catalogue and find the projected direction of the Virgo cluster major
axis by measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the member
galaxies in the two dimensional projected plane. Applying the modified
reconstruction algorithm to the analyzed data, we find that the axial ratio of
the triaxial Virgo cluster is (1: 0.54 : 0.73). This result is consistent with
the recent observational report from the Virgo Cluster Survey, proving the
robustness of the reconstruction algorithm. It is also found that at the inner
radii the shape tends to be more like prolate. We discuss the possible effect
of the Virgo cluster triaxiality on the mass estimation.

based on low-momentum two- and three-nucleon interactions. Our results are
compared to the model-independent virial equation of state and to variational
calculations, and we provide theoretical error estimates by varying the cutoff
used to regulate nuclear interactions. In addition, we study the dependence of
the BCS $^1$S$_0$ superfluid pairing gap on nuclear interactions and on the
cutoff. The resulting gaps are well constrained by the nucleon-nucleon
scattering phase shifts, and the cutoff dependence is very weak for sharp or
sufficiently narrow smooth regulators with cutoffs $\lm > 1.6 \fmi$.

Euclidean analysis of the entropy functional formalism,Oscar J. C. Dias and Pedro J. Silva,"  The attractor mechanism implies that the supersymmetric black hole near
horizon solution is defined only in terms of the conserved charges and is
therefore independent of asymptotic moduli. Starting only with the near horizon
geometry, Sen's entropy functional formalism computes the entropy of an extreme
black hole by means of a Legendre transformation where the electric fields are
defined as conjugated variables to the electric charges. However, traditional
Euclidean methods require the knowledge of the full geometry to compute the
black hole thermodynamic quantities. We establish the connection between the
entropy functional formalism and the standard Euclidean formalism taken at zero
temperature. We find that Sen's entropy function 'f' (on-shell) matches the
zero temperature limit of the Euclidean action. Moreover, Sen's near horizon
angular and electric fields agree with the chemical potentials that are defined
from the zero-temperature limit of the Euclidean formalism.

On the existence of chaotic circumferential waves in spinning disks,"Arzhang Angoshtari, Mir Abbas Jalali","  We use a third-order perturbation theory and Melnikov's method to prove the
existence of chaos in spinning circular disks subject to a lateral point load.
We show that the emergence of transverse homoclinic and heteroclinic points
respectively lead to a random reversal in the traveling direction of
circumferential waves and a random phase shift of magnitude $\pi$ for both
forward and backward wave components. These long-term phenomena occur in
imperfect low-speed disks sufficiently far from fundamental resonances.

"First principles theory of chiral dichroism in electron microscopy
  applied to 3d ferromagnets","Jan Rusz, Stefano Rubino, Peter Schattschneider","  Recently it was demonstrated (Schattschneider et al., Nature 441 (2006),
486), that an analogue of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
experiment can be performed with the transmission electron microscope (TEM).
The new phenomenon has been named energy-loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD).
In this work we present a detailed ab initio study of the chiral dichroism in
the Fe, Co and Ni transition elements. We discuss the methods used for the
simulations together with the validity and accuracy of the treatment, which
can, in principle, apply to any given crystalline specimen. The dependence of
the dichroic signal on the sample thickness, accuracy of the detector position
and the size of convergence and collection angles is calculated.

"QCD thermodynamics and confinement from a dynamical quasiparticle point
  of view",W. Cassing (Univ. of Giessen),"  In this study it is demonstrated that a simple picture of the
  QCD gluon liquid emerges in the dynamical quasiparticle model that specifies
the active degrees of freedom in the time-like sector and yields a potential
energy density in the space-like sector. By using the time-like gluon density
(or scalar gluon density) as an independent degree of freedom - instead of the
temperature $T$ as a Lagrange parameter - variations of the potential energy
density lead to effective mean-fields for time-like gluons and an effective
gluon-gluon interaction strength at low density. The latter yields a simple
dynamical picture for the gluon fusion to color neutral glueballs when
approaching the phase boundary from a temperature higher than $T_c$ and paves
the way for an off-shell transport theoretical description of the parton
dynamics.

"Trellis-Coded Quantization Based on Maximum-Hamming-Distance Binary

This letter presents an alternative approach that instead takes advantage of
maximum-Hamming-distance convolutional codes. The proposed source codes are
shown to be competitive with the best in the literature for the same
computational complexity.

Al-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage
planes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the
STM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant
structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that
they are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed
currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture
simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the
propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular
dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape
of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and
how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of
dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of
the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations
perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured
samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly
influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore
have to be regarded as physical entities.

use it to study the generation of complex magnetic states by adiabatic and
non-equilibrium dynamics.

"Exact distribution of the sample variance from a gamma parent
  distribution",Thomas Royen,"  Several representations of the exact cdf of the sum of squares of n
independent gamma-distributed random variables Xi are given, in particular by a
series of gamma distribution functions. Using a characterization of the gamma
distribution by Laha, an expansion of the exact distribution of the sample
variance is derived by a Taylor series approach with the former distribution as
its leading term. In particular for integer orders alpha some further series
are provided, including a convex combination of gamma distributions for alpha =
1 and nearly of this type for alpha > 1. Furthermore, some representations of
the distribution of the angle Phi between (X1,...,Xn) and (1,...,1) are given
by orthogonal series. All these series are based on the same sequence of easily
computed moments of cos(Phi).

Constraints on Regge models from perturbation theory,Jorge Mondejar and Antonio Pineda,"  We study the constraints that the operator product expansion imposes on large
$N_c$ inspired QCD models for current-current correlators. We focus on the
constraints obtained by going beyond the leading-order parton computation. We
explicitly show that, assumed a given mass spectrum: linear Regge behavior in
$n$ (the principal quantum number) plus corrections in $1/n$, we can obtain the
logarithmic (and constant) behavior in $n$ of the decay constants within a
systematic expansion in $1/n$. Our example shows that it is possible to have
different large $n$ behavior for the vector and pseudo-vector mass spectrum and
yet comply with all the constraints from the operator product expansion.

Asymptotic stability at infinity for bidimensional Hurwitz vector fields,Roland Rabanal,"  Let $X:U-->R^2$ be a differentiable vector field. Set $Spc(X)={eigenvalues of

"Quantitative LEED I-V and ab initio study of the Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface
  structure and the missing half order spots in the 3x1 diffraction pattern","C. Eames, M. I. J. Probert, S. P. Tear","  We have used Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) I-V analysis and ab
initio calculations to quantitatively determine the honeycomb chain model
structure for the Si(111)-3x2-Sm surface. This structure and a similar 3x1
recontruction have been observed for many Alkali-Earth and Rare-Earth metals on
the Si(111) surface. Our ab initio calculations show that there are two almost
degenerate sites for the Sm atom in the unit cell and the LEED I-V analysis
reveals that an admixture of the two in a ratio that slightly favours the site
with the lower energy is the best match to experiment. We show that the I-V
curves are insensitive to the presence of the Sm atom and that this results in
a very low intensity for the half order spots which might explain the
appearance of a 3x1 LEED pattern produced by all of the structures with a 3x2
unit cell.

detection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels may
be unambiguously recognized. The present proposal, called MODULAr, describes a
20 kt fiducial volume LAr-TPC, following very closely the technology developed
for the ICARUS-T60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which we
seek an extended international collaboration:
  (1) the neutrino beam from the CERN 400 GeV proton beam and an optimised horn
focussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the LHC
accelerator improvement program;
  (2) A new experimental area LNGS-B, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axis
from the main Laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. A location is
under consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;
  (3) A new LAr Imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. Such an
increase in the volume over the current ICARUS T600 needs to be carefully
considered. It is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a set
of many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, ""cloning"" the technology of
the T600. Further phases may foresee extensions of MODULAr to meet future
physics goals.
  The experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided a
new hall is excavated in the vicinity of the Gran Sasso Laboratory and adequate
funding and participation are made available.

"Momentum distributions in time-dependent density functional theory:
  Product phase approximation for non-sequential double ionization in strong
  laser fields","F. Wilken, D. Bauer","  We investigate the possibility to deduce momentum space properties from
time-dependent density functional calculations. Electron and ion momentum
distributions after double ionization of a model Helium atom in a strong
few-cycle laser pulse are studied. We show that, in this case, the choice of
suitable functionals for the observables is considerably more important than
the choice of the correlation potential in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham
equations. By comparison with the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation, the insufficiency of functionals neglecting electron correlation is
demonstrated. We construct a functional of the Kohn-Sham orbitals, which in
principle yields the exact momentum distributions of the electrons and the ion.
The product-phase approximation is introduced, which reduces the problem of
approximating this functional significantly.

"Measurements and analysis of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ on an

  A. Loose, A. Lopez, F. Vieira, and E. Baggio-Saitovitch","  The upper critical field $H_{c2}$ is one of the many non conventional
properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates. It is possible that the $H_{c2}(T)$
anomalies are due to the presence of inhomogeneities in the local charge
carrier density $\rho$ of the $CuO_2$ planes. In order to study this point, we
have prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4}$
using the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with a
better cation distribution. In particular, we have studied the temperature
dependence of the second critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$, through the magnetization
measurements on two samples with opposite average carrier concentration
($\rho_m=x$) and nearly the same critical temperature, namely $\rho_m = 0.08$
(underdoped) and $\rho_m = 0.25$ (overdoped). The results close to $T_c$ do not
follow the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory and are interpreted by a theory which
takes into account the influence of the inhomogeneities.

Thermal Hadronization and Hawking-Unruh Radiation in QCD,"P. Castorina, D. Kharzeev and H. Satz","  We conjecture that because of color confinement, the physical vacuum forms an
event horizon for quarks and gluons which can be crossed only by quantum
tunneling, i.e., through the QCD counterpart of Hawking radiation by black
holes. Since such radiation cannot transmit information to the outside, it must
be thermal, of a temperature determined by the chromodynamic force at the
confinement surface, and it must maintain color neutrality. We explore the
possibility that the resulting process provides a common mechanism for thermal
hadron production in high energy interactions, from $e^+e^-$ annihilation to
heavy ion collisions.

Photo-assisted shot noise in Coulomb interacting systems,"A. Crepieux, M. Guigou, A. Popoff, P. Devillard, and T. Martin","  We consider the fluctuations of the electrical current (shot noise) in the

that the derivative of the photo-assisted noise has a staircase behavior. In
the presence of Coulomb interactions, we show that the photo-assisted noise
presents a more complex profile, in particular for the two following systems:
1) a two-dimensional electron gas in the fractional quantum Hall regime for
which we have obtained evenly spaced singularities in the noise derivative,
with a spacing related to the filling factor and, 2) a carbon nanotube for
which a smoothed staircase in the noise derivative is obtained.

"A unified projection formalism for the Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystal
  Xi-approximants and their metadislocations","Michael Engel and Hans-Rainer Trebin (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und
  Angewandte Physik, Universit\""at Stuttgart)","  The approximants xi, xi' and xi'_n of the quasicrystal Al-Mn-Pd display most
interesting plastic properties as for example phason-induced deformation
processes (Klein, H., Audier, M., Boudard, M., de Boissieu, M., Beraha, L., and
Duneau, M., 1996, Phil. Mag. A, 73, 309.) or metadislocations (Klein, H.,
Feuerbacher, M., Schall, P., and Urban, K., 1999, Phys. Rev. Lett., 82, 3468.).
Here we demonstrate that the phases and their deformed or defected states can
be described by a simple projection formalism in three-dimensional space - not
as usual in four to six dimensions. With the method we can interpret
microstructures observed with electron microscopy as phasonic phase boundaries.
Furthermore we determine the metadislocations of lowest energy and relate them
uniquely to experimentally observed ones. Since moving metadislocations in the
xi'-phase can create new phason-planes, we suggest a dislocation induced phase
transition from xi' to xi'_n. The methods developed in this paper can as well
be used for various other complex metallic alloys.

Light stops in the MSSM parameter space,"A.V.Gladyshev, D.I.Kazakov, M.G.Paucar","  We consider the regions of the MSSM parameter space where the top squarks
become light and even may be the LSP. This happens when the triple scalar
coupling A becomes very big compared to m_0. We show that in this case the
requirement that the LSP is neutral imposes noticeable constraint on the
parameter space excluding low m_0 and m_{1/2} similar to constraint from the
Higgs mass limit. In some cases these constraints overlap. This picture takes
place in a wide region of \tan\beta. In a narrow band close to the border line
the stops are long-lived particles and decay into quarks and neutralino
(chargino). The cross-section of their production at LHC via gluon fusion
mechanism in this region may reach a few pb.

"The blue plume population in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: genuine blue
  stragglers or young stellar population?","Y. Momany, E.V. Held, I. Saviane, S. Zaggia, L. Rizzi and M.
  Gullieuszik","  Abridged... Blue stragglers (BSS) are thought to be the product of either
primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies
anti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying the
anti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather than
young main sequence stars.

Generalized characteristic polynomials of graph bundles,"Dongseok Kim, Hye Kyung Kim and Jaeun Lee","  In this paper, we find computational formulae for generalized characteristic
polynomials of graph bundles. We show that the number of spanning trees in a

polynomial of the graph. Since the reciprocal of the Bartholdi zeta function of
a graph can be derived from the generalized characteristic polynomial of a
graph, consequently, the Bartholdi zeta function of a graph bundle can be
computed by using our computational formulae.

"Rotationally-invariant slave-boson formalism and momentum dependence of
  the quasiparticle weight","Frank Lechermann, Antoine Georges, Gabriel Kotliar, Olivier Parcollet","  We generalize the rotationally-invariant formulation of the slave-boson
formalism to multiorbital models, with arbitrary interactions, crystal fields,
and multiplet structure. This allows for the study of multiplet effects on the
nature of low-energy quasiparticles. Non-diagonal components of the matrix of
quasiparticle weights can be calculated within this framework. When combined
with cluster extensions of dynamical mean-field theory, this method allows us
to address the effects of spatial correlations, such as the generation of the
superexchange and the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle weight. We
illustrate the method on a two-band Hubbard model, a Hubbard model made of two
coupled layers, and a two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model (within a
two-site cellular dynamical mean-field approximation).

On the failure of subadditivity of the Wigner-Yanase entropy,Robert Seiringer,"  It was recently shown by Hansen that the Wigner-Yanase entropy is, for
general states of quantum systems, not subadditive with respect to

pure states. We investigate the question whether the weaker property of
subadditivity for pure states with respect to decomposition into more than two
subsystems holds. This property would have interesting applications in quantum
chemistry. We show, however, that it does not hold in general, and provide a
counterexample.

Symmetries and the cosmological constant puzzle,"A.A. Andrianov, F. Cannata, P. Giacconi, A.Yu. Kamenshchik, R. Soldati","  We outline the evaluation of the cosmological constant in the framework of

relation between the vacuum energy problem and the gauge-group spontaneous

the compatible implementation on gravity. We propose to use the discrete
time-reflection transform to formulate a framework in which one can eliminate
the huge contributions of vacuum energy into the effective cosmological
constant and suggest that the breaking of time--reflection symmetry could be
responsible for a small observable value of this constant.

kappa-distribution in the kappa-deformed statistics, based on Kaniadakis
entropy, for a relativistic gas in an electromagnetic field. We derive two
relations for the relativistic gas in the framework of kappa-deformed
statistics, which describe the physical situation represented by the
relativistic kappa-distribution function, provide a reasonable connection
between the parameter kappa, the temperature four-gradient and the four-vector
potential gradient, and thus present for the case kappa different from zero a
clearly physical meaning. It is shown that such a physical situation is a
meta-equilibrium state of the system, but has a new physical characteristic.

A KK-monopole giant graviton in AdS_5 x Y_5,"Bert Janssen, Yolanda Lozano, Diego Rodriguez-Gomez","  We construct a new giant graviton solution in AdS_5 x Y_5, with Y_5 a

this configuration has minimal energy when put in the centre of AdS_5, where it
behaves as a massless particle. When we take Y_5 to be S^5, we provide a
microscopical description in terms of multiple gravitational waves expanding
into the fuzzy S^5 defined as an S^1 bundle over the fuzzy CP^2. Finally we
provide a possible field theory dual interpretation of the construction.

Critical Behavior of a Trapped Interacting Bose Gas,"Tobias Donner, Stephan Ritter, Thomas Bourdel, Anton \""Ottl, Michael

regime, when fluctuations extend far beyond the length scale of thermal de
Broglie waves. Using matter-wave interference we measure the correlation length
of these critical fluctuations as a function of temperature. The diverging
behavior of the correlation length above the critical temperature is observed,
from which we determine the critical exponent of the correlation length for a
trapped, weakly interacting Bose gas to be $\nu=0.67\pm 0.13$. This measurement
has direct implications for the understanding of second order phase
transitions.

Tiling models for metadislocations in AlPdMn approximants,"Michael Engel and Hans-Rainer Trebin (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und

as arrangements of cluster columns on two-dimensional tilings. We substitute
the tiles by Penrose rhombs and show, that alternative tilings can be
constructed by a simple cut and projection formalism in three dimensional
hyperspace. It follows that in the approximants there is a phasonic degree of
freedom, whose excitation results in the reshuffling of the clusters. We apply
the tiling model for metadislocations, which are special textures of partial

kinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a large
manifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effects
self-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of the
original SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to the
dependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameter
kappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numerical
calculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phase
diagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and a
decoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. We
corroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the various
phases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determined
by analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spin
perturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 model
leads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, the
ground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,
which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.

"On the Nature of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources from Optical/IR
  Measurements","Mark Cropper, Christopher Copperwheat, Kinwah Wu, Roberto Soria","  We present a model for the prediction of the optical/infra-red emission from
ULXs. In the model, ULXs are binary systems with accretion taking place through
Roche lobe overflow. We show that irradiation effects and presence of an
accretion disk significantly modify the optical/infrared flux compared to
single stars, and also that the system orientation is important. We include
additional constraints from the mass transfer rate to constrain the parameters
of the donor star, and to a lesser extent the mass of the BH. We apply the
model to fit photometric data for several ULX counterparts. We find that most
donor stars are of spectral type B and are older and less massive than reported
elsewhere, but that no late-type donors are admissable. The degeneracy of the
acceptable parameter space will be significantly reduced with observations over
a wider spectral range, and if time-resolved data become available.

Dephasing due to a fluctuating fractional quantum Hall edge current,"T.K.T Nguyen, A. Crepieux, T. Jonckheere, A.V. Nguyen, Y. Levinson,
  and T. Martin","  The dephasing rate of an electron level in a quantum dot, placed next to a
fluctuating edge current in the fractional quantum Hall effect, is considered.
Using perturbation theory, we first show that this rate has an anomalous
dependence on the bias voltage applied to the neighboring quantum point
contact, because of the Luttinger liquid physics which describes the fractional
Hall fluid. Next, we describe exactly the weak to strong backscattering
crossover using the Bethe-Ansatz solution.

Atoms in the Laves phase play a comparable role to the clusters in the

as significant physical entities.
"
Deformed Wigner crystal in a one-dimensional quantum dot,Yasha Gindikin and Vladimir A. Sablikov,"  The spatial Fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution in a finite
1D system and the distribution function of electrons over single-particle
states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in
their behavior, which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of
Wigner crystal by boundaries. The distribution function has a $\delta$-like
singularity at the Fermi momentum $k_F$. The Fourier spectrum of the density
has a step-like form at the wavevector $2k_F$, with the harmonics being absent
or vanishing above this threshold. These features are found by calculations
using exact diagonalization method. They are shown to be caused by Wigner
ordering of electrons, affected by the boundaries. However the common Luttinger
liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features, because it
overestimates the deformation of the Wigner crystal. An improvement of the
Luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above
features correctly. It is based on the corrected form of the density operator
conserving the particle number.

Curvature in Synthetic Differential Geometry of Groupoids,Hirokazu Nishimura,"  We study the fundamental properties of curvature in groupoids within the

"
Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories?,"Eanna E. Flanagan, Eran Rosenthal","  In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the
intrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly
oriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.
However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of
theories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates
a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action
equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple
to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB
gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the
Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not
apply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the
Hayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called
Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of
this theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for
the torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with
the spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either
ghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems
can be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition
choosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This
yields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction
principle is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does
not couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji
theory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There
may be other torsion theories which do.

Structures in the Universe and Origin of Galaxies,V. A. Rantsev-Kartinov,"  The analysis of images (of obtained in various ranges of the lengths of

dynamic contrasting led author to the conclusions: a) the structures of all
observable galaxies represents a complicated constructions which have the
tendency to self-similarity and made of separate (basic) blocks, which are a
coaxially tubular structures and a cartwheel-like structures; b) the majority
of observable objects in the Universe are luminous butt-ends of almost
invisible (of almost completely transparent) of filamentary formations which
structures are seen only near to their luminous butt-ends; c) the result of
analysis of images of cosmic objects show the structure of many pairs of
cooperating galaxies point to opportunity of their formation at butt-ends
generated in a place of break of the similar filament; d) the interacting
galaxies (M 81 and M 82) show they are butt-ends of sawed off of two branches
of a treelike filament and their interaction is coming out through this
filament; e) as our Universe is in dynamics the processes of formation of
stars, galaxies and their congestions can go presently by means of a fracturing
of filaments with a corresponding diameters and of the time for their such
formation is necessary much less, than along existing standard model.

structures in the disk of the barred galaxy NGC 3367. The images show many
different structures indicating that star formation is going on in the most

molecular gas distribution in the central regions of the galaxy and bipolar
synchrotron emission from the nucleus with two lobes (at 6 kpc) forming a
triple structure similar to a radio galaxy. We have determined the U, B, V, R,

region (nucleus), a region which includes supernovae 2003 AA, and 79 star
associations throughout NGC 3367. Estimation of ages of star associations is
very difficult due to several factors, among them: filling factor, metallicity,
spatial distribution of each structure and the fact that we estimated the
magnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter, equivalent to
$6''.8\sim1.4$ kpc. However, if the colors derived for NGC 3367 were similar to
the colors expected of star clusters with theoretical evolutionary star tracks

  (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und Angewandte Physik, Universit\""at Stuttgart)","  The dynamics of quasicrystals is characterized by the existence of phason
excitations in addition to the usual phonon modes. In order to investigate
their interplay on an elementary level we resort to various one-dimensional
model systems. The main observables are the static, the incoherent, and the
coherent structure factor, which are extracted from molecular dynamics
simulations. For the validation of the algorithms, results for the harmonic
periodic chain are presented. We then study the Fibonacci chain with harmonic
and anharmonic interaction potentials. In the dynamic Fibonacci chain
neighboring atoms interact by double-well potentials allowing for phason flips.
The difference between the structure factors of the dynamic and the harmonic
Fibonacci chain lies in the temperature dependence of the phonon line width. If
a bias is introduced in the well depth, dispersionless optic phonon bands split
off.

A Better Good-Turing Estimator for Sequence Probabilities,"Aaron B. Wagner, Pramod Viswanath, and Sanjeev R. Kulkarni","  We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string
drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that
the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the
size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and
the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the
observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to
probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We
introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing
sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel
sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural
scaling model.

broadening effect on LDRs is also studied. We provide useful calibrations of
effective temperature versus LDRs for giant and main sequence stars with
3800<Teff<6000 K and vsini in the range 0-30 km/s. We found that, with the
exception of very few line pairs, LDRs, measured at a spectral resolution as
high as 42000, depend on vsini and that, by neglecting the rotational
broadening effect, one can mistake the Teff determination of 100 K in the worst
cases.
"
Chaos and Symmetry in String Cosmology,Thibault Damour,"  We review the recently discovered interplay between chaos and symmetry in the
general inhomogeneous solution of many string-related Einstein-matter systems
in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity. The
Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many
Einstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of
superstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain
(infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the
billiard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure
Einstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of
11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of
the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests
that these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding
models. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the
general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the
infinite dimensional coset space E_{10} / K(E_{10}), where K(E_{10}) is the
maximal compact subgroup of E_{10}.

"Radio Emission from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in the Globular
  Cluster G1","James S. Ulvestad, Jenny E. Greene, and Luis C. Ho","  We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) to search for radio emission from the
globular cluster G1 (Mayall-II) in M31. G1 has been reported by Gebhardt et al.
to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of ~2 x 10^4
solar masses. Radio emission was detected within an arcsecond of the cluster
center with an 8.4 GHz power of 2 x 10^{15} W/Hz. The radio/X-ray ratio of G1
is a few hundred times higher than that expected for a high-mass X-ray binary
in the cluster center, but is consistent with the expected value for accretion
onto an IMBH with the reported mass. A pulsar wind nebula is also a possible
candidate for the radio and X-ray emission from G1; future high-sensitivity
VLBI observations might distinguish between this possibility and an IMBH. If
the radio source is an IMBH, and similar accretion and outflow processes occur
for hypothesized ~ 1000-solar-mass black holes in Milky Way globular clusters,
they are within reach of the current VLA and should be detectable easily by the
Expanded VLA when it comes on line in 2010.

Even infinite dimensional real Banach spaces,Valentin Ferenczi and Eloi Medina Galego,"  This article is a continuation of a paper of the first author \cite{F} about
complex structures on real Banach spaces. We define a notion of even infinite
dimensional real Banach space, and prove that there exist even spaces,
including HI or unconditional examples from \cite{F} and $C(K)$ examples due to
Plebanek \cite{P}. We extend results of \cite{F} relating the set of complex
structures up to isomorphism on a real space to a group associated to
inessential operators on that space, and give characterizations of even spaces
in terms of this group. We also generalize results of \cite{F} about totally
incomparable complex structures to essentially incomparable complex structures,
while showing that the complex version of a space defined by S. Argyros and A.
Manoussakis \cite{AM} provide examples of essentially incomparable complex
structures which are not totally incomparable.

"Landau-Lifshitz sigma-models, fermions and the AdS/CFT correspondence",B. Stefanski Jr,"  We define Landau-Lifshitz sigma models on general coset space $G/H$, with $H$
a maximal stability sub-group of $G$. These are non-relativistic models that
have $G$-valued N\""other charges, local $H$ invariance and are classically
integrable. Using this definition, we construct the $PSU(2,2|4)/PS(U(2|2)^2)$
Landau-Lifshitz sigma-model. This sigma model describes the thermodynamic limit
of the spin-chain Hamiltonian obtained from the complete one-loop dilatation
operator of the N=4 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. In the second part of the
paper, we identify a number of consistent truncations of the Type IIB
Green-Schwarz action on $AdS_5\times S^5$ whose field content consists of two
real bosons and 4,8 or 16 real fermions. We show that $\kappa$-symmetry acts
trivially in these sub-sectors. In the context of the large spin limit of the
AdS/CFT correspondence, we map the Lagrangians of these sub-sectors to
corresponding truncations of the $PSU(2,2|4)/PS(U(2|2)^2)$ Landau-Lifshitz
sigma-model.

Trajectory of neutron$-$neutron$-^{18}C$ excited three-body state,"M. T. Yamashita, T. Frederico and Lauro Tomio","  The trajectory of the first excited Efimov state is investigated by using a
renormalized zero-range three-body model for a system with two bound and one
virtual two-body subsystems. The approach is applied to $n-n-^{18}$C, where the
$n-n$ virtual energy and the three-body ground state are kept fixed. It is
shown that such three-body excited state goes from a bound to a virtual state
when the $n-^{18}$C binding energy is increased. Results obtained for the
$n-^{19}$C elastic cross-section at low energies also show dominance of an
$S-$matrix pole corresponding to a bound or virtual Efimov state. It is also
presented a brief discussion of these findings in the context of ultracold atom
physics with tunable scattering lengths.

Distributed quantum information processing with minimal local resources,Earl T. Campbell,"  We present a protocol for growing graph states, the resource for one-way
quantum computing, when the available entanglement mechanism is highly
imperfect. The distillation protocol is frugal in its use of ancilla qubits,
requiring only a single ancilla qubit when the noise is dominated by one Pauli
error, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce
local resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of
purification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a
biased random walk, and that a target fidelity is likely to be reached more
rapidly than for a comparable post-selecting protocol. An analysis is presented
of how imperfect local operations limit the attainable fidelity. For example, a
single Pauli error rate of 20% can be distilled down to $\sim 10$ times the
imperfection in local operations.

"Sparse Estimators and the Oracle Property, or the Return of Hodges'
  Estimator","Hannes Leeb, Benedikt M. Poetscher","  We point out some pitfalls related to the concept of an oracle property as
used in Fan and Li (2001, 2002, 2004) which are reminiscent of the well-known
pitfalls related to Hodges' estimator. The oracle property is often a
consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying
a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss
function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the
loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the
framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that
setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in
finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator
introduced in Fan and Li (2001). We find that this estimator can perform rather
poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to
maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator
is tuned to sparsity.

"Capillary ordering and layering transitions in two-dimensional hard-rod
  fluids",Yuri Martinez-Raton,"  In this article we calculate the surface phase diagram of a two-dimensional
hard-rod fluid confined between two hard lines. In a first stage we study the
semi-infinite system consisting of an isotropic fluid in contact with a single
hard line. We have found complete wetting by the columnar phase at the
wall-isotropic fluid interface. When the fluid is confined between two hard
walls, capillary columnar ordering occurs via a first-order phase transition.
For higher chemical potentials the system exhibits layering transitions even
for very narrow slits (near the one-dimensional limit). The theoretical model
used was a density-functional theory based on the Fundamental-Measure
Functional applied to a fluid of hard rectangles in the restricted-orientation
approximation (Zwanzig model). The results presented here can be checked
experimentally in two-dimensional granular media made of rods, where vertical
motions induced by an external source and excluded volume interactions between
the grains allow the system to explore those stationary states which
entropically maximize packing configurations. We claim that some of the surface
phenomena found here can be present in two-dimensional granular-media fluids.
"
Generation of Entanglement Outside of the Light Cone,J.D. Franson,"  The Feynman propagator has nonzero values outside of the forward light cone.
That does not allow messages to be transmitted faster than the speed of light,
but it is shown here that it does allow entanglement and mutual information to
be generated at space-like separated points. These effects can be interpreted
as being due to the propagation of virtual photons outside of the light cone or
as a transfer of pre-existing entanglement from the quantum vacuum. The
differences between these two interpretations are discussed.

"Monte Carlo Simulations of Quantum Spin Systems in the Valence Bond
  Basis",A. W. Sandvik and K. S. D. Beach,"  We discuss a projector Monte Carlo method for quantum spin models formulated
in the valence bond basis, using the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet as an
example. Its singlet ground state can be projected out of an arbitrary basis
state as the trial state, but a more rapid convergence can be obtained using a
good variational state. As an alternative to first carrying out a time
consuming variational Monte Carlo calculation, we show that a very good trial
state can be generated in an iterative fashion in the course of the simulation
itself. We also show how the properties of the valence bond basis enable
calculations of quantities that are difficult to obtain with the standard basis
of Sz eigenstates. In particular, we discuss quantities involving
finite-momentum states in the triplet sector, such as the dispersion relation
and the spectral weight of the lowest triplet.

Emergence of U(1) symmetry in the 3D XY model with Zq anisotropy,"Jie Lou, Anders W. Sandvik, Leon Balents","  We study the three-dimensional XY model with a Z_q anisotropic term. At

above a length scale Lambda, which diverges as a power of the correlation
length; Lambda ~ xi^a_q. Below Lambda the order parameter is U(1) symmetric. We
derive the full scaling function controlling the emergence of U(1) symmetry and
use Monte Carlo results to extract the exponent a_q for q=4,...,8. We find that
a_q = a_4 (q/4)^2, with a_4 only marginally larger than 1. We discuss these
results in the context of U(1) symmetry at ""deconfined"" quantum critical points

Existence of Universal Entangler,"Jianxin Chen, Runyao Duan, Zhengfeng Ji, Mingsheng Ying and Jun Yu","  A gate is called entangler if it transforms some (pure) product states to

powerful device for generating entanglements, and thus provides important
physical resources for accomplishing many tasks in quantum computing and
quantum information. This Letter demonstrates that a universal entangler always
exists except for a degenerated case. Nevertheless, the problem how to find a
universal entangler remains open.

Fan-shaped and toric textures of mesomorphic oxadiazoles,"A. Sparavigna, A. Mello, B. Montrucchio","  When a family of non symmetrical heterocycled compounds is investigated, a
variety of mesophases can be observed with rather different features. Here we
report the behaviour of seven different members among a family of such
materials, that consists of mesomorphic oxadiazole compounds. In two of these
compounds, the optical microscope investigation shows very interesting
behaviours. In their smectic phases, fan-shaped and toric textures, sometimes
with periodic instability, are observed. Moreover, the nematic phase displays a
texture transition. Texture transitions have been previously observed only
inside the nematic phase of some compounds belonging to the families of the
oxybenzoic and cyclohexane acids. In these two oxadiazole compounds we can
observe what we define as a ""toric nematic phase"", heating the samples from the
smectic phase. The toric nematic texture disappears as the sample is further
heated, changing into a smooth texture.

First we establish a Williams' decomposition of the genealogy of the total

lineage of the last individual alive. This allows us give a closed formula for
the probability of simultaneous extinction of the Eve-population and the total

  hyperbolic threefold",Chris Austin,"  The field equations and boundary conditions of Horava-Witten theory,
compactified on a smooth compact spin quotient of CH^3, where CH^3 denotes the
hyperbolic cousin of CP^3, are studied in the presence of Casimir energy
density terms. If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a
certain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10^5 in
units of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is
found that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary
becoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative
ways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized
consistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant
are considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in
the classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10^{13}
in units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed
cosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions
have reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer
surface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third
alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra
fluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps
three-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the
thick pipe. Some problems related to fitting the strong/electroweak Standard
Model are considered.

Balance of forces in simulated bilayers,J. Stecki,"  Two kinds of simulated bilayers are described and the results are reported
for lateral tension and for partial contributions of intermolecular forces to
it.Data for a widest possible range of areas per surfactant head, from tunnel
formation through tensionless state, transition to floppy bilayer,to its
disintegration, are reported and discussed. The significance of the tensionless
state, is discussed. Conclusions: (1) the tensionless state is a
coincidence;(2) the transition from extended to floppy bilayer occurs nearby
and has hallmarks of a phase transition (3) there is no theory of that
transition.(4)The lateral tension of the floppy bilayer scales with size; that
of the extended bilayer does not depend on size. (4) The drumhead model not
appropriate for interfaces as these fluctuate via diffusion.(5) The radius of
gyration also! shows a discontinuity.

Search for the radiative leptonic decay B+ --> gamma l+ nu,"The BABAR Collaboration, B. Aubert, et al","  We present the results of a search for $B^{+}\to\gamma \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$,
where $\ell = e, \mu$. We use a sample of 232 million $B\bar{B}$ pairs recorded
at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $B$ Factory. We
measure a partial branching fraction $\Delta\mathcal{B}$ in a restricted region
of phase space that reduces the effect of theoretical uncertainties, requiring
the lepton energy to be between 1.875 and 2.850GeV, the photon energy to be
between 0.45 and 2.35GeV, and the cosine of the angle between the lepton and
photon momenta to be less than -0.36, with all quantities computed in the
$\Upsilon(4S)$ center-of-mass frame. We find $\Delta\mathcal{B}(B^{+}\to\gamma
\ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}) = (-0.3^{+1.3}_{-1.5} ({stat}) \pm 0.6 ({syst}) \pm 0.1
({th})) \times 10^{-6}$, assuming lepton universality. Interpreted as a 90%
C.L. Bayesian upper limit, the result corresponds to $1.7\times10^{-6}$ for a
prior flat in amplitude, and $2.3\times10^{-6}$ for a prior flat in branching
fraction.

Possible experimental manifestations of the many-body localization,"D. M. Basko, I. L. Aleiner, and B. L. Altshuler","  Recently, it was predicted that if all one-electron states in a
non-interacting disordered system are localized, the interaction between
electrons in the absence of coupling to phonons leads to a finite-temperature
metal-insulator trnasition. Here we show that even in the presence of a weak
coupling to phonons the transition manifests itself (i) in the nonlinear
conduction, leading to a bistable $I$-$V$ curve, (ii) by a dramatic enhancement
of the nonequilibrium current noise near the transition.

Magnetic structure of Sm2IrIn8,"C. Adriano, R. Lora-Serrano, C. Giles, F. de Bergevin, J. C. Lang, G.
  Srajer, C. Mazzoli, L. Paolasini and P. G. Pagliuso","  The magnetic structure of the intermetallic antiferromagnet Sm2IrIn8 was
determined using x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Below TN = 14.2,
Sm2IrIn8 has a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation
vector (1/2,0,0). The Sm magnetic moments lie in the ab plane and are rotated
roughly 18 degrees away from the a axis. The magnetic structure of this
compound was obtained by measuring the strong dipolar resonant peak whose
enhancement was of over two orders of magnitude at the L2 edge. At the L3 edge
both quadrupolar and dipolar features were observed in the energy line shape.
The magnetic structure and properties of Sm2IrIn8 are found to be consistent
with the general trend already seen for the Nd-, Tb- and the Ce-based compounds
from the RmMnIn3m+2n family (R = rare earth; M=Rh or Ir, m = 1, 2; n = 0, 1),
where the crystalline electrical field (CEF) effects determine the direction of
magnetic moments and the TN evolution in the series. The measured Neel
temperature for Sm2IrIn8 is slightly suppressed when compared to the TN of the
parent cubic compound SmIn3.

TEXES Observations of Pure Rotational H2 Emission From AB Aurigae,"M.A. Bitner, M.J. Richter, J.H. Lacy, T.K. Greathouse, D.T. Jaffe,
  G.A. Blake","  We present observations of pure rotational molecular hydrogen emission from
the Herbig Ae star, AB Aurigae. Our observations were made using the Texas
Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) at the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility and the Gemini North Observatory. We searched for H2 emission in the
S(1), S(2), and S(4) lines at high spectral resolution and detected all three.
By fitting a simple model for the emission in the three transitions, we derive
T = 670 +/- 40 K and M = 0.52 +/- 0.15 earth masses for the emitting gas. Based
on the 8.5 km/s FWHM of the S(2) line, assuming the emission comes from the
circumstellar disk, and with an inclination estimate of the AB Aur system taken
from the literature, we place the location for the emission near 18 AU.
Comparison of our derived temperature to a disk structure model suggests that
UV and X-ray heating are important in heating the disk atmosphere.

Deciphering top flavor violation at the LHC with B factories,"Patrick J. Fox, Zoltan Ligeti, Michele Papucci, Gilad Perez, Matthew
  D. Schwartz","  The LHC will have unprecedented sensitivity to flavor-changing neutral
current (FCNC) top quark decays, whose observation would be a clear sign of
physics beyond the standard model. Although many details of top flavor
violation are model dependent, the standard model gauge symmetries relate top
FCNCs to other processes, which are strongly constrained by existing data. We
study these constraints in a model independent way, using a low energy
effective theory from which the new physics is integrated out. We consider the
most important operators which contribute to top FCNCs and analyze the current
constraints on them. We find that the data rule out top FCNCs at a level
observable at the LHC due to most of the operators comprising left-handed first
or second generation quark fields, while there remains a substantial window for
top decays mediated by operators with right-handed charm or up quarks. If FCNC
top decays are observed at the LHC, such an analysis may help decipher the
underlying physics.

Exploring Infrared Properties of Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies,"Nurur Rahman, Justin H. Howell, George Helou, Joseph M. Mazzarella,
  and Brent Buckalew (IPAC/Caltech)","  Abridged: We present analysis of Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the
three low surface brightness (LSB) optical giant galaxies Malin 1, UGC 6614 and
UGC 9024. Mid- and far-infrared morphology, spectral energy distributions, and
integrated colors are used to derive the dust mass, dust-to-gas mass ratio,
total infrared luminosity, and star formation rate (SFR). The 8 micron images
indicate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are present in the
central regions of all three metal-poor LSB galaxies. The diffuse optical disks
of Malin 1 and UGC 9024 remain undetected at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.
The dustiest of the three LSB galaxies, UGC 6614, has infrared morphology that
varies significantly with wavelength. The 8 and 24 micron emission is
co-spatial with H\alpha emission previously observed in the outer ring of UGC
6614. The estimated dust-to-gas ratios, from less than 10^{-3} to 10^{-2},
support previous indications that the LSB galaxies are relatively dust poor
compared to the HSB galaxies. The total infrared luminosities are approximately
1/3 to 1/2 the blue band luminosities, suggesting that old stellar populations
are the primary source of dust heating in these LSB objects. The SFR estimated
from the infrared data ranges ~0.01-0.88 M_sun yr^{-1}, consistent with results
from optical studies.

One-time pad booster for Internet,Geraldo A. Barbosa,"  One-time pad encrypted files can be sent through Internet channels using
current Internet protocols. However, the need for renewing shared secret keys
make this method unpractical. This work shows how users can use a fast physical
random generator based on fluctuations of a light field and the Internet
channel to directly boost key renewals. The transmitted signals are
deterministic but carries imprinted noise that cannot be eliminated by the
attacker. Thus, a one-time pad for Internet can be made practical. Security is
achieved without third parties and not relying on the difficulty of factoring
numbers in primes. An informational fragility to be avoided is discussed.
Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are
determined.

A Local Concept of Wave Velocities,"I.V. Drozdov, A.A. Stahlhofen","  The classical characterization of \wp, as a typical concept for far field
phenomena, has been successfully applied to many \w phenomena in past decades.
The recent reports of superluminal tunnelling times and negative group
velocities challenged this concept. A new local approach for the definition of
\wvs avoiding these difficulties while including the classical definitions as
particular cases is proposed here. This generalisation of the conventional
non-local approach can be applied to arbitrary \w forms and propagation media.
Some applications of the formalism are presented and basic properties of the
concept are summarized.

  Stanescu and G. Kotliar","  We study the superconducting state of the hole-doped two-dimensional Hubbard
model using Cellular Dynamical Mean Field Theory, with the Lanczos method as
impurity solver. In the under-doped regime, we find a natural decomposition of
the one-particle (photoemission) energy-gap into two components. The gap in the
nodal regions, stemming from the anomalous self-energy, decreases with
decreasing doping. The antinodal gap has an additional contribution from the
normal component of the self-energy, inherited from the normal-state pseudogap,
and it increases as the Mott insulating phase is approached.

"Wavelet frames, Bergman spaces and Fourier transforms of Laguerre

wavelet analysis as do the Hermite functions in Gabor analysis. We will use
them as analyzing wavelets in a similar way the Hermite functions were recently

find a sufficient density condition for constructing frames by translations and
dilations of the Fourier transform of the nth Laguerre function. As in
Groechenig-Lyubarskii theorem, the density increases with n, and in the special
case of the hyperbolic lattice in the upper half plane it is given by b\log
a<\frac{4\pi}{2n+\alpha}, where alpha is the parameter of the Laguerre

Where the monotone pattern (mostly) rules,Miklos Bona,"  We consider pattern containment and avoidance with a very tight definition
that was used first by Riordan more than 60 years ago. Using this definition,
we prove the monotone pattern is easier to avoid than almost any other pattern
of the same length.
  We also show that with this definition, almost all patterns of length $k$ are
avoided by the same number of permutations of length $n$. The corresponding
statements are not known to be true for more relaxed definitions of pattern
containment. This is the first time we know of that expectations are used to
compare numbers of permutations avoiding certain patterns.
"
Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory,Jon A. Bailey,"  Although taste violations significantly affect the results of staggered
calculations of pseudoscalar and heavy-light mesonic quantities, those entering
staggered calculations of baryonic quantities have not been quantified. Here I
develop staggered chiral perturbation theory in the light-quark baryon sector
by mapping the Symanzik action into heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory.
For 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, the masses of flavor-symmetric nucleons are
calculated to third order in partially quenched and fully dynamical staggered
chiral perturbation theory. To this order the expansion includes the leading
chiral logarithms, which come from loops with virtual decuplet-like states, as
well as terms the order of the cubed pion mass, which come from loops with
virtual octet-like states. Taste violations enter through the meson propagators
in loops and tree-level terms the order of the squared lattice spacing. The
pattern of taste symmetry breaking and the resulting degeneracies and mixings
are discussed in detail. The resulting chiral forms are appropriate to lattice
results obtained with operators already in use and could be used to study the
restoration of taste symmetry in the continuum limit. I assume that the fourth
root of the fermion determinant can be incorporated in staggered chiral
perturbation theory using the replica method.

studies of electron transport. Here we report the direct imaging of magnetic
focusing of electron waves, specifically in a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG). We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along
a boundary in the 2DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the
electron waves. Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled
scanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory
demonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an
interferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of
electron waves. This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves
between two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study
systems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.

"On a {K_4,K_{2,2,2}}-ultrahomogeneous graph",Italo J. Dejter,"  The existence of a connected 12-regular $\{K_4,K_{2,2,2}\}$-ultrahomogeneous
graph $G$ is established, (i.e. each isomorphism between two copies of $K_4$ or
$K_{2,2,2}$ in $G$ extends to an automorphism of $G$), with the 42 ordered
lines of the Fano plane taken as vertices. This graph $G$ can be expressed in a
unique way both as the edge-disjoint union of 42 induced copies of $K_4$ and as
the edge-disjoint union of 21 induced copies of $K_{2,2,2}$, with no more
copies of $K_4$ or $K_{2,2,2}$ existing in $G$. Moreover, each edge of $G$ is
shared by exactly one copy of $K_4$ and one of $K_{2,2,2}$. While the line
graphs of $d$-cubes, ($3\le d\in\ZZ$), are $\{K_d, K_{2,2}\}$-ultrahomogeneous,
$G$ is not even line-graphical. In addition, the chordless 6-cycles of $G$ are
seen to play an interesting role and some self-dual configurations associated
to $G$ with 2-arc-transitive, arc-transitive and semisymmetric Levi graphs are
considered.

"Unconventional approaches to combine optical transparency with
  electrical conductivity",J.E. Medvedeva,"  Combination of electrical conductivity and optical transparency in the same
material -- known to be a prerogative of only a few oxides of post-transition
metals, such as In, Sn, Zn and Cd -- manifests itself in a distinctive band
structure of the transparent conductor host. While the oxides of other elements
with $s^2$ electronic configuration, for example, Mg, Ca, Sc and Al, also
exhibit the desired optical and electronic features, they have not been
considered as candidates for achieving good electrical conductivity because of
the challenges of efficient carrier generation in these wide-bandgap materials.
Here we demonstrate that alternative approaches to the problem not only allow
attaining the transport and optical properties which compete with those in
currently utilized transparent conducting oxides (TCO), but also significantly
broaden the range of materials with a potential of being developed into novel
functional transparent conductors.

analyses. This paper reports on multisite campaigns of the pulsating sdB stars
PG 1618+563B and PG 0048+091. Data were obtained from observatories placed
around the globe for coverage from all longitudes. For PG 1618+563B, our
five-site campaign uncovered a dichotomy of pulsation states: Early during the
campaign the amplitudes and phases (and perhaps frequencies) were quite
variable while data obtained late in the campaign were able to fully resolve
five stable pulsation frequencies. For PG 0048+091, our five-site campaign
uncovered a plethora of frequencies with short pulsation lifetimes. We find
them to have observed properties consistent with stochastically excited
oscillations, an unexpected result for subdwarf B stars. We discuss our
findings and their impact on subdwarf B asteroseismology.

"Connecting microscopic simulations with kinetically constrained models
  of glasses",Matthew T. Downton and Malcolm P. Kennett,"  Kinetically constrained spin models are known to exhibit dynamical behavior
mimicking that of glass forming systems. They are often understood as
coarse-grained models of glass formers, in terms of some ""mobility"" field. The
identity of this ""mobility"" field has remained elusive due to the lack of
coarse-graining procedures to obtain these models from a more microscopic point
of view. Here we exhibit a scheme to map the dynamics of a two-dimensional soft
disc glass former onto a kinetically constrained spin model, providing an
attempt at bridging these two approaches.

"DIRBE Minus 2MASS: Confirming the CIRB in 40 New Regions at 2.2 and 3.5
  Microns","L.R. Levenson, E.L. Wright (UCLA), B.D. Johnson (Columbia)","  With the release of the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog, stellar fluxes
from 2MASS are used to remove the contribution due to Galactic stars from the
intensity measured by DIRBE in 40 new regions in the North and South Galactic
polar caps. After subtracting the interplanetary and Galactic foregrounds, a
consistent residual intensity of 14.69 +/- 4.49 kJy/sr at 2.2 microns is found.
Allowing for a constant calibration factor between the DIRBE 3.5 microns and
the 2MASS 2.2 microns fluxes, a similar analysis leaves a residual intensity of
15.62 +/- 3.34 kJy/sr at 3.5 microns. The intercepts of the DIRBE minus 2MASS
correlation at 1.25 microns show more scatter and are a smaller fraction of the
foreground, leading to a still weak limit on the CIRB of 8.88 +/- 6.26 kJy/sr
(1 sigma).

"Averaging of the electron effective mass in multicomponent transparent
  conducting oxides",J.E. Medvedeva,"  We find that layered materials composed of various oxides of cations with
$s^2$ electronic configuration, $XY_2$O$_4$, $X$=In or Sc, $Y$=Ga, Zn, Al, Cd
and/or Mg, exhibit isotropic electron effective mass which can be obtained via
averaging over those of the corresponding single-cation oxide constituents.
This effect is due to a hybrid nature of the conduction band formed from the
s-states of {\it all} cations and the oxygen p-states. Moreover, the observed
insensitivity of the electron effective mass to the oxygen coordination and to
the distortions in the cation-oxygen chains suggests that similar behavior can
be expected in technologically important amorphous state. These findings
significantly broaden the range of materials as efficient transparent conductor
hosts.

"Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Stars Across the Upper Main Sequence:
  II. Observed distribution of the magnetic field geometry","S. Hubrig, P. North, M. Schoeller","  We re-discuss the evolutionary state of upper main sequence magnetic stars
using a sample of Ap and Bp stars with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and
definitely determined longitudinal magnetic fields. We confirm our previous
results obtained from the study of Ap and Bp stars with accurate measurements
of the mean magnetic field modulus and mean quadratic magnetic fields that
magnetic stars of mass M < 3 M_sun are concentrated towards the centre of the
main-sequence band. In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to be
concentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearby
open clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.
Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massive
stars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is found
for any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magnetic
flux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence. An
excess of stars with large obliquities beta is detected in both higher and
lower mass stars. The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from the
distribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars become
observable on the H-R diagram. After quite a short time spent on the main
sequence, the obliquity angle beta tends to reach values close to either 90 deg
or 0 deg for M < 3 M_sun. The evolution of the obliquity angle beta seems to be
somewhat different for low and high mass stars. While we find a strong hint for
an increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M
> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun. However, the
predominance of high values of beta at advanced ages in these stars is notable.
"
A Diagrammatic Category for the Representation Theory of U_q(sl_n),Scott Morrison,"  This thesis provides a partial answer to a question posed by Greg Kuperberg
in q-alg/9712003 and again by Justin Roberts as problem 12.18 in ""Problems on
invariants of knots and 3-manifolds"", math.GT/0406190, essentially: ""Can one
describe the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n)
(thought of as a spherical category) via generators and relations?""
  For each n \geq 0, I define a certain tensor category of trivalent graphs,
modulo isotopy, and construct a functor from this category onto (a full
subcategory of) the category of representations of the quantum group U_q(sl_n).
One would like to describe completely the kernel of this functor, by providing
generators. The resulting quotient of the diagrammatic category would then be a
category equivalent to the representation category of U_q(sl_n).
  I make significant progress towards this, describing certain generators of
the kernel, and some obstructions to further elements. It remains a conjecture
that these relations generate the kernel. My results extend those of
q-alg/9712003, MR1659228, math.QA/0310143 and math.GT/0506403.
  The argument is essentially by constructing a diagrammatic version of the
forgetful functor coming from the inclusion of U_q(sl_{n-1}) in U_q(sl_n}. We
know this functor is faithful, so a diagram is in the kernel for n exactly if
its image under the diagrammatic forgetful functor is in the kernel for n-1.
This allows us to perform inductive calculations, both establishing families of
elements of the kernel, and finding obstructions.

The Formation of Lake Stars,Victor C. Tsai and J. S. Wettlaufer,"  Star patterns, reminiscent of a wide range of diffusively controlled growth
forms from snowflakes to Saffman-Taylor fingers, are ubiquitous features of ice
covered lakes. Despite the commonality and beauty of these ``lake stars'' the
underlying physical processes that produce them have not been explained in a
coherent theoretical framework. Here we describe a simple mathematical model
that captures the principal features of lake-star formation; radial fingers of
(relatively warm) water-rich regions grow from a central source and evolve
through a competition between thermal and porous media flow effects in a
saturated snow layer covering the lake. The number of star arms emerges from a
stability analysis of this competition and the qualitative features of this
meter-scale natural phenomena are captured in laboratory experiments.
"
A Higgs-Higgs bound state due to New Physics at a TeV,Benjamin Grinstein and Michael Trott,"  We examine the effects of new physics effecting the Higgs sector of the
standard model, focusing on the effects on the Higgs self couplings. We
demonstrate that a low mass higgs, m_h < 2 m_t, can have a strong effective
self coupling due to the effects of a new interaction at a TeV. We investigate
the possibility that the first evidence of such an interaction could be a
higgs-higgs bound state. To this end, we construct an effective field theory
formalism to examine the physics of such a low mass higgs boson. We explore the
possibility of a non relativistic bound state of the higgs field (Higgsium) at
LHC and construct a non relativistic effective field theory of the higgs sector
that is appropriate for such studies (NRHET).

Measuring two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement,"G. F. Calvo, A. Pic\'on, and A. Bramon","  We put forward an approach to estimate the amount of bipartite spatial
entanglement of down-converted photon states correlated in orbital angular
momentum and the magnitude of the transverse (radial) wave vectors. Both
degrees of freedom are properly considered in our framework, which only
requires azimuthal local linear optical transformations and mode selection
analysis with two fiber detectors. The coincidence distributions predicted by
our approach give an excellent fit to the distributions measured in a recent
experiment aimed to show the very high-dimensional transverse entanglement of
twin photons from a down-conversion source. Our estimate for the Schmidt number
is substantially lower but still confirms the presence of high-dimensional
entanglement.

HST/ACS Coronagraphic Observations of the Dust Surrounding HD 100546,"D.R. Ardila, D.A. Golimowski, J.E. Krist, M. Clampin, H.C. Ford, and
  G.D. Illingworth","  We present ACS/HST coronagraphic observations of HD 100546, a B9.5 star, 103
pc away from the sun, taken in the F435W, F606W, and F814W bands. Scattered
light is detected up to 14'' from the star. The observations are consistent
with the presence of an extended flattened nebula with the same inclination as
the inner disk. The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and they
trail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are also
seen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become more
neutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with models
that assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the major
disk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \Delta
(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags. To explain
these colors, we explore the role of asymmetric scattering, reddening, and
large minimum sizes on ISM-like grains. We conclude each of these hypotheses by
itself cannot explain the colors. The disk colors are similar to those derived
for Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible for
their colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only the
geometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the optically
thick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observed
spiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that the
extended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocessed

"Anomalous diffusion and stretched exponentials in heterogeneous
  glass-forming liquids: Low-temperature behavior",J. S. Langer and S. Mukhopadhyay,"  We propose a model of a heterogeneous glass forming liquid and compute the
low-temperature behavior of a tagged molecule moving within it. This model
exhibits stretched-exponential decay of the wavenumber-dependent, self
intermediate scattering function in the limit of long times. At temperatures
close to the glass transition, where the heterogeneities are much larger in
extent than the molecular spacing, the time dependence of the scattering
function crosses over from stretched-exponential decay with an index $b=1/2$ at
large wave numbers to normal, diffusive behavior with $b = 1$ at small
wavenumbers. There is a clear separation between early-stage, cage-breaking
$\beta$ relaxation and late-stage $\alpha$ relaxation. The spatial
representation of the scattering function exhibits an anomalously broad
exponential (non-Gaussian) tail for sufficiently large values of the molecular
displacement at all finite times.

Modeling the Solar Chromosphere,M. Carlsson,"  Spectral diagnostic features formed in the solar chromosphere are few and
difficult to interpret -- they are neither formed in the optically thin regime
nor in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To probe the state of the
chromosphere, both from observations and theory, it is therefore necessary with
modeling. I discuss both traditional semi-empirical modeling, numerical
experiments illustrating important ingredients necessary for a self-consistent
theoretical modeling of the solar chromosphere and the first results of such
models.

A compact star rotating at 1122 Hz and the r-mode instability,"Alessandro Drago (Univ. Ferrara and INFN sez. Ferrara, Italy) Giuseppe

  Germany and INFN Italy) and Irene Parenti (Univ. Ferrara and INFN sez.

compact star rotating at a submillisecond period. In particular, the only
viable astrophysical scenario for such an object, present inside the Low Mass
X-ray Binary associated with the x-ray transient XTE J1739-285, is that it has
a strangeness content. Since previous analysis indicate that hyperonic stars or
stars containing a kaon condensate are not good candidates, the only remaining
possibility is that such an object is either a strange quark star or a hybrid
quark-hadron star. We also discuss under which conditions sub-millisecond
pulsars are rare.

"3d Numerical Models of the Chromosphere, Transition Region, and Corona","Viggo H. Hansteen, Mats Carlsson, Boris Gudiksen","  A major goal in solar physics has during the last five decades been to find
how energy flux generated in the solar convection zone is transported and
dissipated in the outer solar layers. Progress in this field has been slow and
painstaking. However, advances in computer hardware and numerical methods,
vastly increased observational capabilities and growing physical insight seem
finally to be leading towards understanding. Here we present exploratory
numerical MHD models that span the entire solar atmosphere from the upper
convection zone to the lower corona. These models include non-grey, non-LTE
radiative transport in the photosphere and chromosphere, optically thin
radiative losses as well as magnetic field-aligned heat conduction in the
transition region and corona.

"Gauge Invariant Factorisation and Canonical Quantisation of

  Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, (2) Department of Physics, University of
  Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, Rep. South Africa, (3) International Chair in
  Mathematical Physics and Applications (ICMPA-UNESCO), Cotonou, Rep. Benin)","  Abelian topologically massive gauge theories (TMGT) provide a topological
mechanism to generate mass for a bosonic p-tensor field in any spacetime
dimension. These theories include the 2+1 dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons and
3+1 dimensional Cremmer-Scherk actions as particular cases. Within the
Hamiltonian formulation, the embedded topological field theory (TFT) sector
related to the topological mass term is not manifest in the original phase
space. However through an appropriate canonical transformation, a gauge
invariant factorisation of phase space into two orthogonal sectors is feasible.
The first of these sectors includes canonically conjugate gauge invariant
variables with free massive excitations. The second sector, which decouples
from the total Hamiltonian, is equivalent to the phase space description of the
associated non dynamical pure TFT. Within canonical quantisation, a likewise
factorisation of quantum states thus arises for the full spectrum of TMGT in
any dimension. This new factorisation scheme also enables a definition of the
usual projection from TMGT onto topological quantum field theories in a most
natural and transparent way. None of these results rely on any gauge fixing
procedure whatsoever.

Towards Functional Flows for Hierarchical Models,Daniel F. Litim,"  The recursion relations of hierarchical models are studied and contrasted
with functional renormalisation group equations in corresponding
approximations. The formalisms are compared quantitatively for the Ising
universality class, where the spectrum of universal eigenvalues at criticality
is studied. A significant correlation amongst scaling exponents is pointed out
and analysed in view of an underlying optimisation. Functional flows are
provided which match with high accuracy all known scaling exponents from
Dyson's hierarchical model for discrete block-spin transformations.
Implications of the results are discussed.

High Precision CTE-Measurement of SiC-100 for Cryogenic Space-Telescopes,"K. Enya, N. Yamada, T. Onaka, T. Nakagawa, H. Kaneda, M. Hirabayashi,
  Y. Toulemont, D. Castel, Y. Kanai, and N. Fujishiro","  We present the results of high precision measurements of the thermal
expansion of the sintered SiC, SiC-100, intended for use in cryogenic
space-telescopes, in which minimization of thermal deformation of the mirror is
critical and precise information of the thermal expansion is needed for the
telescope design. The temperature range of the measurements extends from room
temperature down to $\sim$ 10 K. Three samples, #1, #2, and #3 were
manufactured from blocks of SiC produced in different lots. The thermal
expansion of the samples was measured with a cryogenic dilatometer, consisting
of a laser interferometer, a cryostat, and a mechanical cooler. The typical
thermal expansion curve is presented using the 8th order polynomial of the
temperature. For the three samples, the coefficients of thermal expansion
(CTE), $\bar{\alpha}_{#1}$, $\bar{\alpha}_{#2}$, and $\bar{\alpha}_{#3}$ were
derived for temperatures between 293 K and 10 K. The average and the dispersion
(1 $\sigma$ rms) of these three CTEs are 0.816 and 0.002 ($\times 10^{-6}$/K),
respectively. No significant difference was detected in the CTE of the three
samples from the different lots. Neither inhomogeneity nor anisotropy of the
CTE was observed. Based on the obtained CTE dispersion, we performed an
finite-element-method (FEM) analysis of the thermal deformation of a 3.5 m
diameter cryogenic mirror made of six SiC-100 segments. It was shown that the
present CTE measurement has a sufficient accuracy well enough for the design of
the 3.5 m cryogenic infrared telescope mission, the Space Infrared telescope
for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA).

Compton Scattering of Fe K alpha Lines in Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables,"A.L. McNamara, Z. Kuncic, K. Wu, D.K. Galloway and J.G. Cullen","  Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies.
We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm demonstrating
the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha
lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column. The peak line
emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration
and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that
line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly
magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and
which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The
resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have
also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a
realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant
overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated
line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per
indicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from
Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.

The Limits of Special Relativity,B.G. Sidharth,"  The Special Theory of Relativity and the Theory of the Electron have had an
interesting history together. Originally the electron was studied in a non
relativistic context and this opened up the interesting possibility that lead
to the conclusion that the mass of the electron could be thought of entirely in
electromagnetic terms without introducing inertial considerations. However the
application of Special Relativity lead to several problems, both for an
extended electron and the point electron. These inconsistencies have, contrary
to popular belief not been resolved satisfactorily today, even within the
context of Quantum Theory. Nevertheless these and subsequent studies bring out
the interesting result that Special Relativity breaks down within the Compton
scale or when the Compton scale is not neglected. This again runs contrary to
an uncritical notion that Special Relativity is valid for point particles.

small dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in the
Taurus-Auriga young cluster, using Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared
spectra. In turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure and
composition of these 1-2 Myr-old disks around Solar- and later-type young
stars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in the
conversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. We find strong evidence
of evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of the
structure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fraction
is strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. We also confirm that
the crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r < 10 AU. However, we
see no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar mass
or luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, as
would be expected in the standard models of dust processing based upon
photo-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,
accretion-heating-driven annealing at r < 1 AU, or spiral-shock heating at r <
10 AU, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. Either another
grain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must be
at work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. We propose one
of each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely X-ray heating
and annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure by
giant-planetary formation and migration.

Comprehensive simulations of superhumps,"Amanda J. Smith (1), Carole A. Haswell (1), James R. Murray (2),
  Michael R. Truss (3), Stephen B. Foulkes (1) ((1) The Open University, (2)
  Swinburne University of Technology, (3) Durham University)","  (Abridged) We use 3D SPH calculations with higher resolution, as well as with
more realistic viscosity and sound-speed prescriptions than previous work to
examine the eccentric instability which underlies the superhump phenomenon in
semi-detached binaries. We illustrate the importance of the two-armed spiral
mode in the generation of superhumps. Differential motions in the fluid disc
cause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhump
cycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. We
compare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary to
faithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedented
durations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high mass
ratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improved
simulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhump
period excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observed
black hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lower
disc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due to
higher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscous
dissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of the
disc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,
the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a new
equilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. We
quantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.
We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and show
that the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.

Singular Energy Distributions in Granular Media,E. Ben-Naim and A. Zippelius,"  We study the kinetic theory of driven granular gases, taking into account
both translational and rotational degrees of freedom. We obtain the high-energy
tail of the stationary bivariate energy distribution, depending on the total
energy E and the ratio x=sqrt{E_w/E} of rotational energy E_w to total energy.
Extremely energetic particles have a unique and well-defined distribution f(x)
which has several remarkable features: x is not uniformly distributed as in
molecular gases; f(x) is not smooth but has multiple singularities. The latter
behavior is sensitive to material properties such as the collision parameters,
the moment of inertia and the collision rate. Interestingly, there are
preferred ratios of rotational-to-total energy. In general, f(x) is strongly
correlated with energy and the deviations from a uniform distribution grow with
energy. We also solve for the energy distribution of freely cooling Maxwell
Molecules and find qualitatively similar behavior.

  Non-gravitational Effects","Hyesung Kang (Pusan National University, Korea), Dongsu Ryu (Chungnam
  National University, Korea), Renyue Cen (Princeton University, USA), and J.
  P. Ostriker (Princeton University, USA)","  Cosmological shock waves result from supersonic flow motions induced by
hierarchical clustering of nonlinear structures in the universe. These shocks
govern the nature of cosmic plasma through thermalization of gas and
acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. We study the statistics
and energetics of shocks formed in cosmological simulations of a concordance
$\Lambda$CDM universe, with a special emphasis on the effects of
non-gravitational processes such as radiative cooling, photoionization/heating,
and galactic superwind feedbacks. Adopting an improved model for gas
thermalization and CR acceleration efficiencies based on nonlinear diffusive
shock acceleration calculations, we then estimate the gas thermal energy and
the CR energy dissipated at shocks through the history of the universe. Since
shocks can serve as sites for generation of vorticity, we also examine the
vorticity that should have been generated mostly at curved shocks in
cosmological simulations. We find that the dynamics and energetics of shocks
are governed primarily by the gravity of matter, so other non-gravitational
processes do not affect significantly the global energy dissipation and
vorticity generation at cosmological shocks. Our results reinforce scenarios in
which the intracluster medium and warm-hot intergalactic medium contain
energetically significant populations of nonthermal particles and turbulent
flow motions.

the first T dwarf 7 years after that, we have amassed a large list of these

understanding the physical chemistry of their atmospheres, some important
issues remain unexplained. Three of these are the subject of this paper: (1)
What is the role of ""second parameters"" such as gravity and metallicity in
shaping the emergent spectra of L and T dwarfs? Can we establish a robust
classification scheme so that objects with unusual values of log(g) or [M/H],
unusual dust content, or unresolved binarity are easily recognized? (2) Which
physical processes drive the unusual behavior at the L/T transition? Which
observations can be obtained to better confine the problem? (3) What will
objects cooler than T8 look like? How will we know a Y dwarf when we first
observe one?

(65489) Ceto/Phorcys (provisionally designated 2003 FX128) reveal it to be a
close binary system. The mutual orbit has a period of 9.554 +/- 0.011 days and
a semimajor axis of 1840 +/- 48 km. These values enable computation of a system
mass of (5.41 +/- 0.42) 10^18 kg. Spitzer Space Telescope observations of
thermal emission at 24 and 70 microns are combined with visible photometry to
constrain the system's effective radius (109 +10/-11 km) and geometric albedo
(0.084 +0.021/-0.014). We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37
+0.66/-0.32 g cm^-3, consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceous
materials. This density contrasts with lower densities recently measured with
the same technique for three other comparably-sized outer Solar System binaries
(617) Patroclus, (26308) 1998 SM165, and (47171) 1999 TC36, and is closer to
the density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe. The mutual orbit of
Ceto and Phorcys is nearly circular, with an eccentricity <= 0.015. This
observation is consistent with calculations suggesting that the system should
tidally evolve on a timescale shorter than the age of the solar system.

GLRT-Optimal Noncoherent Lattice Decoding,"Daniel J. Ryan, Iain B. Collings and I. Vaughan L. Clarkson","  This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for
noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading

ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block
length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation.
We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show
that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the
optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose
to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission
(PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.

obtained at IRTF/SpeX on 17 nights during 2001-2005. The spectra reveal for the
first time the presence of CO2 ice on the surfaces of Umbriel and Titania, by
means of 3 narrow absorption bands near 2 microns. Several additional, weaker
CO2 ice absorptions have also been detected. No CO2 absorption is seen in
Oberon spectra, and the strengths of the CO2 ice bands decline with
planetocentric distance from Ariel through Titania. We use the CO2 absorptions
to map the longitudinal distribution of CO2 ice on Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania,
showing that it is most abundant on their trailing hemispheres. We also examine
H2O ice absorptions in the spectra, finding deeper H2O bands on the leading
hemispheres of Ariel, Umbriel, and Titania, but the opposite pattern on Oberon.
Potential mechanisms to produce the observed longitudinal and planetocentric
distributions of the two ices are considered.

"Extremely strong-coupling superconductivity and anomalous lattice

KOs2O6 are studied by means of thermodynamic and transport measurements. It is
shown that the superconductivity is of conventional s-wave type and lies in the
extremely strong-coupling regime. Specific heat and resistivity measurements
reveal that there are characteristic low-energy phonons that give rise to
unusual scattering of carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions. The
entity of the low-energy phonons is ascribed to the heavy rattling of the K ion
confined in an oversized cage made of OsO6 octahedra. It is suggested that this
electron-rattler coupling mediates the Cooper pairing, resulting in the
extremely strong-coupling superconductivity.

Analysis of low energy pion spectra,Suk Choi and Kang Seog Lee,"  The transverse mass spectra and the rapidity distributions of $\pi^+$ and
$\pi^-$ in Au-Au collisions at 2, 4, 6, and 8 GeV$\cdot$A by E895 collaboration
are fitted using an elliptically expanding fireball model with the contribution
from the resonance decays and the final state Coulomb interaction. The ratio of
the total number of produced $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ is used to fit the data. The
resulting freeze-out temperature is rather low($T_f < 60$ MeV) with large
transverse flow and thus resonance contribution is very small. The difference
in the shape of $m_t$ spectra of the oppositely charged pions are found to be
due to the Coulomb interaction of the pions.

A study of the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction,"N. J. Upadhyay, K. P. Khemchandani, B. K. Jain, N. G. Kelkar","  A study of the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction in the energy range where the
recent data from Uppsala are available, is done in the two-step model of $\eta$
production including the final state interaction. The $\eta -d$ final state
interaction is incorporated through the solution of the Lippmann Schwinger
equation using an elastic scattering matrix element, $T_{\eta d \to \eta d}$,
which is required to be half off-shell. It is written in a factorized form,
with an off-shell form factor multiplying an on-shell part given by an
effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum. The parameters of
this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic Faddeev
equation solution for the $\eta NN$ system corresponding to different $\eta-N$
scattering amplitudes. Calculations have also been done using few body
equations within a finite rank approximation (FRA) to generate $T_{\eta d \to
\eta d}$. The $p-d$ final state interaction is included in the spirit of the
Watson-Migdal prescription by multiplying the matrix element by the inverse of
the Jost function. The $\eta-d$ interaction is found to be dominant in the
region of small invariant $\eta -d$ mass, $M_{\eta d}$. The $p-d$ interaction
enhances the cross section in the whole region of $M_{\eta d}$, but is larger
for large $M_{\eta d}$. We find nearly isotropic angular distributions of the
proton and the deuteron in the final state. All the above observations are in
agreement with data. The production mechanism for the entire range of the
existing data on the $p d \to p d \eta$ reaction seems to be dominated by the
two-step model of $\eta$ production.

this paper applications of their formula to more general cases are discussed.
It is shown that this formalism can be generalized to various cases where the
matter potential have off-diagonal components, and the two non-trivial examples
are given: the case with magnetic moments and a magnetic field and the case
with non-standard interactions. It is pointed out that their formalism can be
applied also to the case in the long baseline limit with matter whose density
varies adiabatically as in the case of solar neutrino.

The Phase-resolved High Energy Spectrum of the Crab Pulsar,"J.J. Jia, Anisia P.S. Tang, J. Takata, H.K. Chang, K.S.Cheng","  We present a modified outer gap model to study the phase-resolved spectra of
the Crab pulsar. A theoretical double peak profile of the light curve
containing the whole phase is shown to be consistent with the observed light
curve of the Crab pulsar by shifting the inner boundary of the outer gap
inwardly to $\sim 10$ stellar radii above the neutron star surface. In this
model, the radial distances of the photons corresponding to different phases
can be determined in the numerical calculation. Also the local electrodynamics,
such as the accelerating electric field, the curvature radius of the magnetic
field line and the soft photon energy, are sensitive to the radial distances to
the neutron star. Using a synchrotron self-Compton mechanism, the
phase-resolved spectra with the energy range from 100 eV to 3 GeV of the Crab

Critical Current of Type-II Superconductors in a Broken Bose Glass State,J. P. Rodriguez,"  The tilt modulus of a defective Abrikosov vortex lattice pinned by material
line defects is computed using the boson analogy. It tends to infinity at long
wavelength, which yields a Bose glass state that is robust to the addition of
weak point-pinning centers, and which implies a restoring force per vortex line
for rigid translations about mechanical equilibrium that is independent of
magnetic field. It also indicates that the Bose glass state breaks into pieces
along the direction of the correlated pinning centers if the latter have finite
length. The critical current is predicted to crossover from two dimensional to
three dimensional behavior as a function of sample thickness along the
correlated pinning centers in such case. That crossover notably can occur at a
film thickness that is much larger than that expected from point pins of
comparable strength. The above is compared to the dependence on thickness shown
by the critical current in certain films of high-temperature superconductors
currently being developed for wire technology.

networks, which is equivalent to an optimal cooperation problem, in which the
agents try to optimize the total sum of pair cooperation benefits and the
supports of independent projects. The agents are found to be typically of two
kinds: a fraction of $m$ (being the magnetization of the Potts model) belongs
to a large cooperating cluster, whereas the others are isolated one man's
projects. It is shown rigorously that the homogeneous model has a strongly
first-order phase transition, which turns to second-order for random
interactions (benefits), the properties of which are studied numerically on the
Barab\'asi-Albert network. The distribution of finite-size transition points is
characterized by a shift exponent, $1/\tilde{\nu}'=.26(1)$, and by a different

system sizes up to $1024^2$ were carried out to examine the logarithmic
divergence of the surface roughness above the transition temperature, revealing
clear evidence for universal scaling of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type.

  Multiples of $c=26$ III. The Spectra of $\hat{c}=52$ Strings",M.B. Halpern,"  In the second paper of this series, I obtained the twisted BRST systems and
extended physical-state conditions of all twisted open and closed $\hat{c} =
52$ strings. In this paper, I supplement the extended physical-state conditions
with the explicit form of the extended (twisted) Virasoro generators of all
$\hat{c} = 52$ strings, which allows us to discuss the physical spectra of
these systems. Surprisingly, all the $\hat{c}=52$ spectra admit an equivalent
description in terms of generically-unconventional Virasoro generators at
$c=26$. This description strongly supports our prior conjecture that the
$\hat{c}=52$ strings are free of negative-norm states, and moreover shows that
the spectra of some of the simpler cases are equivalent to those of ordinary
untwisted open and closed $c=26$ strings.

$SO(2m)/Sp(m)$. We show that this space admits a structure of $Z_2^2$-symmetric
space. We describe all the non degenerated metrics and classify the Riemannian

Quasiparticles in Neon using the Faddeev Random Phase Approximation,"C. Barbieri (GSI), D. Van Neck (Ghent) and W. H. Dickhoff (St.Louis)","  The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding
the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method
describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated
two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are
obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff
framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction
[ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as
well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy.
Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the
energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate
for the high-density electron gas.

Discrete Nonholonomic Lagrangian Systems on Lie Groupoids,"D. Iglesias, J.C. Marrero, D. Martin de Diego, E. Martinez","  This paper studies the construction of geometric integrators for nonholonomic
systems. We derive the nonholonomic discrete Euler-Lagrange equations in a
setting which permits to deduce geometric integrators for continuous
nonholonomic systems (reduced or not). The formalism is given in terms of Lie
groupoids, specifying a discrete Lagrangian and a constraint submanifold on it.
Additionally, it is necessary to fix a vector subbundle of the Lie algebroid
associated to the Lie groupoid. We also discuss the existence of nonholonomic
evolution operators in terms of the discrete nonholonomic Legendre
transformations and in terms of adequate decompositions of the prolongation of
the Lie groupoid. The characterization of the reversibility of the evolution
operator and the discrete nonholonomic momentum equation are also considered.
Finally, we illustrate with several classical examples the wide range of
application of the theory (the discrete nonholonomic constrained particle, the
Suslov system, the Chaplygin sleigh, the Veselova system, the rolling ball on a
rotating table and the two wheeled planar mobile robot).

Pseudogap and charge density waves in two dimensions,"S. V. Borisenko, A. A. Kordyuk, A. N. Yaresko, V. B. Zabolotnyy, D. S.
  Inosov, R. Schuster, B. Buechner, R. Weber, R. Follath, L. Patthey, H. Berger","  An interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations (phonons) results in
two fundamental quantum phenomena in solids: in three dimensions it can turn a
metal into a superconductor whereas in one dimension it can turn a metal into
an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of the
most studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW is
driven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.
Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,
experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoretical
approaches. The magnitude, character and anisotropy of the 2D-CDW pseudogap are
intriguingly similar to those seen in superconducting cuprates.

Supersymmetric Field Theory Based on Generalized Uncertainty Principle,Yuuichirou Shibusa (RIKEN),"  We construct a quantum theory of free fermion field based on the generalized
uncertainty principle using supersymmetry as a guiding principle. A
supersymmetric field theory with a real scalar field and a Majorana fermion
field is given explicitly and we also find that the supersymmetry algebra is
deformed from an usual one.

Optimal flexibility for conformational transitions in macromolecules,"Richard A. Neher, Wolfram Mobius, Erwin Frey, Ulrich Gerland","  Conformational transitions in macromolecular complexes often involve the
reorientation of lever-like structures. Using a simple theoretical model, we
show that the rate of such transitions is drastically enhanced if the lever is
bendable, e.g. at a localized ""hinge''. Surprisingly, the transition is fastest
with an intermediate flexibility of the hinge. In this intermediate regime, the
transition rate is also least sensitive to the amount of ""cargo'' attached to
the lever arm, which could be exploited by molecular motors. To explain this
effect, we generalize the Kramers-Langer theory for multi-dimensional barrier
crossing to configuration dependent mobility matrices.

"AFM Imaging of SWI/SNF action: mapping the nucleosome remodeling and
  sliding","Fabien Montel, Emeline Fontaine, Philippe St-Jean, Martin Castelnovo,
  Cendrine Moskalenko-Faivre","  We propose a combined experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) and theoretical
study of the structural and dynamical properties of nucleosomes. In contrast to
biochemical approaches, this method allows to determine simultaneously the DNA
complexed length distribution and nucleosome position in various contexts.
First, we show that differences in the nucleo-proteic structure observed
between conventional H2A and H2A.Bbd variant nucleosomes induce quantitative
changes in the in the length distribution of DNA complexed with histones. Then,
the sliding action of remodeling complex SWI/SNF is characterized through the
evolution of the nucleosome position and wrapped DNA length mapping. Using a
linear energetic model for the distribution of DNA complexed length, we extract
the net wrapping energy of DNA onto the histone octamer, and compare it to
previous studies.

"When the orbit algebra of group is an integral domain? Proof of a
  conjecture of P.J. Cameron",Maurice Pouzet,"  P.J.Cameron introduced the orbit algebra of a permutation group and
conjectured that this algebra is an integral domain if and only if the group
has no finite orbit. We prove that this conjecture holds and in fact that the
age algebra of a relational structure $R$ is an integral domain if and only if
$R$ is age-inexhaustible. We deduce these results from a combinatorial lemma
asserting that if a product of two non-zero elements of a set algebra is zero
then there is a finite common tranversal of their supports. The proof is built
on Ramsey theorem and the integrity of a shuffle algebra.

Saturated actions by finite dimensional Hopf *-algebras on C*-algebras,J. A. Jeong and G. H. Park,"  If a finite group action $\alpha$ on a unital $C^*$-algebra $M$ is saturated,
the canonical conditional expectation $E:M\to M^\alpha$ onto the fixed point
algebra is known to be of index finite type with $Index(E)=|G|$ in the sense of
Watatani. More generally if a finite dimensional Hopf $*$-algebra $A$ acts on
$M$ and the action is saturated, the same is true with $Index (E)=\dim(A)$. In
this paper we prove that the converse is true. Especially in case $M$ is a
commutative $C^*$-algebra $C(X)$ and $\alpha$ is a finite group action, we give
an equivalent condition in order that the expectation $E:C(X)\to C(X)^\alpha$
is of index finite type, from which we obtain that $\alpha$ is saturated if and
only if $G$ acts freely on $X$.
  Actions by compact groups are also considered to show that the gauge action
$\gamma$ on a graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(E)$ associated with a locally finite
directed graph $E$ is saturated.

"The electronic structures, the equilibrium geometries and finite
  temperature properties of Na_n (n=39-55)","Shahab Zorriasatein, Mal-Soon Lee, and D. G. Kanhere","  Density-functional theory has been applied to investigate systematics of
sodium clusters Na_n in the size range of n= 39-55. A clear evolutionary trend
in the growth of their ground-state geometries emerges. The clusters at the
beginning of the series (n=39-43) are symmetric and have partial icosahedral
(two-shell) structure. The growth then goes through a series of disordered
clusters (n=44-52) where the icosahedral core is lost. However, for n>52 a
three shell icosahedral structure emerges. This change in the nature of the
geometry is abrupt. In addition, density-functional molecular dynamics has been
used to calculate the specific heat curves for the representative sizes n= 43,
45, 48 and 52. These results along with already available thermodynamic
calculations for n= 40, 50, and 55 enable us to carry out a detailed comparison
of the heat capacity curves with their respective geometries for the entire
series. Our results clearly bring out strong correlation between the evolution
of the geometries and the nature of the shape of the heat capacities. The
results also firmly establish the size-sensitive nature of the heat capacities
in sodium clusters.
"
Quantum Zeno Effect in the Decoherent Histories,Petros Wallden,"  The quantum Zeno effect arises due to frequent observation. That implies the
existence of some experimenter and its interaction with the system. In this
contribution, we examine what happens for a closed system if one considers a
quantum Zeno type of question, namely: ""what is the probability of a system,
remaining always in a particular subspace"". This has implications to the
arrival time problem that is also discussed. We employ the decoherent histories
approach to quantum theory, as this is the better developed formulation of
closed system quantum mechanics, and in particular, dealing with questions that
involve time in a non-trivial way. We get a very restrictive decoherence
condition, that implies that even if we do introduce an environment, there will
be very few cases that we can assign probabilities to these histories, but in
those cases, the quantum Zeno effect is still present.

  Nolting (1) ((1) Festkoerpertheorie, HU Berlin, (2) Theoretische Physik I, TU
  Ilmenau)","  In this work we compare numerically exact Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations and Green function theory (GFT) calculations of thin ferromagnetic
films including second order anisotropies. Thereby we concentrate on easy plane
systems, i.e. systems for which the anisotropy favors a magnetization parallel
to the film plane. We discuss these systems in perpendicular external field,
i.e. B parallel to the film normal. GFT results are in good agreement with QMC
for high enough fields and temperatures. Below a critical field or a critical
temperature no collinear stable magnetization exists in GFT. On the other hand
QMC gives finite magnetization even below those critical values. This indicates
that there occurs a transition from non-collinear to collinear configurations
with increasing field or temperature. For slightly tilted external fields a
rotation of magnetization from out-of-plane to in-plane orientation is found
with decreasing temperature.

Matrix Ordered Operator Algebras,"Ekaterina Juschenko, Stanislav Popovych","  We study the question when for a given *-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ a sequence of

characterization of operator algebras which are completely boundedly isomorphic

Properly infinite C(X)-algebras and K_1-injectivity,"Etienne Blanchard, Randi Rohde, Mikael Rordam","  We investigate if a unital C(X)-algebra is properly infinite when all its

several different ways, including the question if every unital properly
infinite C*-algebra is K_1-injective. We provide partial answers to these
questions, and we show that the general question on proper infiniteness of
C(X)-algebras can be reduced to establishing proper infiniteness of a specific
C([0,1])-algebra with properly infinite fibres.

"An information-based traffic control in a public conveyance system:
  reduced clustering and enhanced efficiency","A. Tomoeda, K. Nishinari, D. Chowdhury and A. Schadschneider","  A new public conveyance model applicable to buses and trains is proposed in
this paper by using stochastic cellular automaton. We have found the optimal
density of vehicles, at which the average velocity becomes maximum,
significantly depends on the number of stops and passengers behavior of getting
on a vehicle at stops. The efficiency of the hail-and-ride system is also
discussed by comparing the different behavior of passengers. Moreover, we have
found that a big cluster of vehicles is divided into small clusters, by
incorporating information of the number of vehicles between successive stops.

A separable deformation of the quaternion group algebra,Nurit Barnea and Yuval Ginosar,"  The Donald-Flanigan conjecture asserts that for any finite group and for any
field, the corresponding group algebra can be deformed to a separable algebra.
The minimal unsolved instance, namely the quaternion group over a field of
characteristic 2 was considered as a counterexample. We present here a
separable deformation of the quaternion group algebra. In a sense, the
conjecture for any finite group is open again.

"On the residue fields of Henselian valued stable fields, II",I.D. Chipchakov,"  Let $E$ be a primarily quasilocal field, $M/E$ a finite Galois extension and
$D$ a central division $E$-algebra of index divisible by $[M\colon E]$. In
addition to the main result of Part I, this part of the paper shows that if the
Galois group $G(M/E)$ is not nilpotent, then $M$ does not necessarily embed in
$D$ as an $E$-subalgebra. When $E$ is quasilocal, we find the structure of the
character group of its absolute Galois group; this enables us to prove that if
$E$ is strictly quasilocal and almost perfect, then the divisible part of the
multiplicative group $E ^{\ast}$ equals the intersection of the norm groups of
finite Galois extensions of $E$.

Chromospheric Cloud-Model Inversion Techniques,Kostas Tziotziou,"  Spectral inversion techniques based on the cloud model are extremely useful
for the study of properties and dynamics of various chromospheric cloud-like
structures. Several inversion techniques are reviewed based on simple (constant
source function) and more elaborated cloud models, as well as on grids of
synthetic line profiles produced for a wide range of physical parameters by
different NLTE codes. Several examples are shown of how such techniques can be
used in different chromospheric lines, for the study of structures of the quiet
chromosphere, such as mottles/spicules, as well as for active region structures
such as fibrils, arch filament systems (AFS), filaments and flares.

"Dust covering factor, silicate emission and star formation in luminous
  QSOs","R. Maiolino, O. Shemmer, M. Imanishi, H. Netzer, E. Oliva, D. Lutz, E.
  Sturm","  We present Spitzer IRS low resolution, mid-IR spectra of a sample of 25 high
luminosity QSOs at 2<z<3.5. When combined with archival IRS observations of
local, low luminosity type-I AGNs, the sample spans five orders of magnitude in
luminosity. We find that the continuum dust thermal emission at
lambda(rest)=6.7um is correlated with the optical luminosity, following the
non-linear relation L(6.7um) propto L(5100A)^0.82. We also find an anti
correlation between the ratio L(6.7um)/L(5100A) and the [OIII]5007A line
luminosity. These effects are interpreted as a decreasing covering factor of
the circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. Such a result is in
agreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function of
luminosity recently found in various surveys. We clearly detect the silicate
emission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects.
These are the Silicate emission in the most luminous objects obtained so far.
When combined with the silicate emission observed in local, low luminosity
type-I AGNs, we find that the silicate emission strength is correlated with
luminosity.
  The silicate strength of all type-I AGNs also follows a positive correlation
with the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. The Polycyclic Aromatic
Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, expected from starburst activity, are not
detected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z QSOs. The upper limit
inferred from the average spectrum points to a ratio between PAH luminosity and
QSO optical luminosity significantly lower than observed in lower luminosity
AGNs, implying that the correlation between star formation rate and AGN power
saturates at high luminosities.

"Generating entanglement of photon-number states with coherent light via

scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent
light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within
the reach of current technology. We study in detail the generation of the
entangled states between two modes, and that among three modes. In addition to
the Bell states between two modes and the W states among three modes, we find
plentiful new kinds of entangled states. Finally, the scheme can be extend to
generate the entangled states among more than three modes.

  Granato (3), A. Bressan (3) ((1) ICC, Durham, (2) INAF, Trieste, (3) INAF,
  Padova)","  We present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,
number counts and redshift distributions in the IR based on the Lambda-CDM
cosmological model. We use the combined GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy
formation model and GRASIL spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy SEDs
including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. The model, which is the same
as that in Baugh et al (2005), assumes two different IMFs: a normal solar
neighbourhood IMF for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavy
IMF in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We have shown previously that
the top-heavy IMF seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faint
sub-mm galaxies. We compare the model with observational data from the SPITZER
Space Telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen before
SPITZER data became available. We find that the model matches the observed
evolution in the IR remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probed
by SPITZER. In particular, the SPITZER data show that there is strong evolution
in the mid-IR galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, and
this is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.
On the other hand, a model with a normal IMF in starbursts predicts far too
little evolution in the mid-IR luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

Use of Triangular Elements for Nearly Exact BEM Solutions,"Supratik Mukherjee, Nayana Majumdar","  A library of C functions yielding exact solutions of potential and flux
influences due to uniform surface distribution of singularities on flat
triangular and rectangular elements has been developed. This library, ISLES,
has been used to develop the neBEM solver that is both precise and fast in
solving a wide range of problems of scientific and technological interest. Here
we present the exact expressions proposed for computing the influence of
uniform singularity distributions on triangular elements and illustrate their
accuracy. We also present a study concerning the time taken to evaluate these
long and complicated expressions \textit{vis a vis} that spent in carrying out
simple quadratures. Finally, we solve a classic benchmark problem in
electrostatics, namely, estimation of the capacitance of a unit square plate
raised to unit volt. For this problem, we present the estimated values of
capacitance and compare them successfully with some of the most accurate
results available in the literature. In addition, we present the variation of
the charge density close to the corner of the plate for various degrees of
discretization. The variations are found to be smooth and converging. This is
in clear contrast to the criticism commonly leveled against usual BEM solvers.

"The effect of the solar corona on the attenuation of small-amplitude
  prominence oscillations. I. Longitudinal magnetic field","R. Soler, R. Oliver and J. L. Ballester","  Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar
prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of
the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding
oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is
still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick
radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their
role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The
dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived
considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an
unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel
to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the
dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is
obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect
of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode
and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the
internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the
fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and
the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external
corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow
modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.
Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic
modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those
observed.

Energy and Momentum Distributions of Kantowski and Sachs Space-time,Ragab M. Gad and A. Fouad,"  We use the Einstein, Bergmann-Thomson, Landau-Lifshitz and Papapetrou

definitions furnish a consistent result for the energy distribution, but the

Green functions and nonlinear systems: Short time expansion,Marco Frasca,"  We show that Green function methods can be straightforwardly applied to

Higher order corrections can be then computed giving a satisfactory agreement

possibility of fully exploiting a gradient expansion in both classical and
quantum field theory granting the existence of a strong coupling expansion.
Having a Green function in this regime in quantum field theory amounts to
obtain the corresponding spectrum of the theory.

"One-way permutations, computational asymmetry and distortion",Jean-Camille Birget,"  Computational asymmetry, i.e., the discrepancy between the complexity of
transformations and the complexity of their inverses, is at the core of one-way
transformations. We introduce a computational asymmetry function that measures
the amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length
asymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational
asymmetry. We relate boolean circuits to words in a Thompson monoid, over a
fixed generating set, in such a way that circuit size is equal to word-length.
Moreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a
Thompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to
word-length. We show that circuits built with gates that are not constrained to
have fixed-length inputs and outputs, are at most quadratically more compact
than circuits built from traditional gates (with fixed-length inputs and
outputs). Finally, we show that the computational asymmetry function is closely
related to certain distortion functions: The computational asymmetry function
is polynomially equivalent to the distortion of the path length in Schreier
graphs of certain Thompson groups, compared to the path length in Cayley graphs
of certain Thompson monoids. We also show that the results of Razborov and
others on monotone circuit complexity lead to exponential lower bounds on
certain distortions.

"A method for the direct determination of the surface gravities of
  transiting extrasolar planets","John Southworth (1), Peter J. Wheatley (1), Giles Sams (1), ((1)
  University of Warwick, UK)","  We show that the surface gravity of a transiting extrasolar planet can be
calculated from only the spectroscopic orbit of its parent star and the
analysis of its transit light curve. This does not require additional
constraints, such as are often inferred from theoretical stellar models or
model atmospheres. The planet's surface gravity can therefore be measured
precisely and from only directly observable quantities. We outline the method
and apply it to the case of the first known transiting extrasolar planet, HD
209458b. We find a surface gravity of g_p = 9.28 +/- 0.15 m/s, which is an
order of magnitude more precise than the best available measurements of its
mass, radius and density. This confirms that the planet has a much lower
surface gravity that that predicted by published theoretical models of gas
giant planets. We apply our method to all fourteen known transiting extrasolar
planets and find a significant correlation between surface gravity and orbital
period, which is related to the known correlation between mass and period. This
correlation may be the underlying effect as surface gravity is a fundamental
parameter in the evaporation of planetary atmospheres.

On restrictions of balanced 2-interval graphs,"Philippe Gambette (LIAFA), St\'ephane Vialette (LRI)","  The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling

Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and

generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and
(x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions
are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval
graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints
on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying
relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs,

Exchange parameters from approximate self-interaction correction scheme,A. Akande and S. Sanvito,"  The approximate atomic self-interaction corrections (ASIC) method to density
functional theory is put to the test by calculating the exchange interaction
for a number of prototypical materials, critical to local exchange and
correlation functionals. ASIC total energy calculations are mapped onto an
Heisenberg pair-wise interaction and the exchange constants J are compared to
those obtained with other methods. In general the ASIC scheme drastically
improves the bandstructure, which for almost all the cases investigated
resemble closely available photo-emission data. In contrast the results for the
exchange parameters are less satisfactory. Although ASIC performs reasonably
well for systems where the magnetism originates from half-filled bands, it
suffers from similar problems than those of LDA for other situations. In
particular the exchange constants are still overestimated. This reflects a
subtle interplay between exchange and correlation energy, not captured by the
ASIC.

of this paper is to find a more general analytical expression for a surface

"Retarded electric and magnetic fields of a moving charge: Feynman's
  derivation of Li\'enard-Wiechert potentials revisited",J.H. Field,"  Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and
the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the
conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter,
of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding
retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with
those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors.
The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those
derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the
Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time
derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.

between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed
clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog
contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the
UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where
available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large
Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The
intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to
10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion
of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the
dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical
single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33
field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater
than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and
discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more
complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square
degrees centered on M33.

Proper motion L and T dwarf candidate members of the Pleiades,"S.L.Casewell, P.D. Dobbie, S.T. Hodgkin, E. Moraux, R.F. Jameson, N.C.
  Hambly, J. Irwin, N Lodieu","  We present the results of a deep optical-near-infrared multi-epoch survey
covering 2.5 square degrees of the Pleiades open star cluster to search for new
very-low-mass brown dwarf members. A significant (~ 5 year) epoch difference
exists between the optical (CFH12k I-, Z-band) and near infrared (UKIRT WFCAM
J-band) observations. We construct I,I-Z and Z,Z-J colour magnitude diagrams to
select candidate cluster members. Proper motions are computed for all candidate
members and compared to the background field objects to further refine the
sample. We recover all known cluster members within the area of our survey. In
addition, we have discovered 9 new candidate brown dwarf cluster members. The 7
faintest candidates have red Z-J colours and show blue near-infrared colours.
These are consistent with being L and T-type Pleiads. Theoretical models
predict their masses to be around 11 Jupiter masses.

"A Study of Catalogued Nearby Galaxy Clusters in the SDSS-DR4: I. Cluster
  Global Properties","J. A. L. Aguerri, R. Sanchez-Janssen and C. Munoz-Tunon","  We have selected a sample of 88 nearby (z<0.1) galaxy clusters from the
SDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derived
global properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,
velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in
two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of
10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to
be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster
centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The
brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the
smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity
dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the
outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing
velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the
fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster
velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation
between the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results
indicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.
Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than
early-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster
global properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.
These observational results suggest that the global environment could be
important for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster
($\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key
role in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.

"Optical implementation and entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence
  bond states",Gerardo Adesso and Marie Ericsson,"  We study Gaussian valence bond states of continuous variable systems,
obtained as the outputs of projection operations from an ancillary space of M
infinitely entangled bonds connecting neighboring sites, applied at each of $N$
sites of an harmonic chain. The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence
bond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement
engineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which
is isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this
mechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from
the chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical
schemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which
correspond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the
output Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum
communication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and
teleportation networks, is finally discussed.

Rich magnetic phase diagram in the Kagome-staircase compound Mn3V2O8,"E. Morosan, J. Fleitman, T. Klimczuk and R. J. Cava","  Mn3V2O8 is a magnetic system in which S = 5/2 Mn2+ is found in the kagome
staircase lattice. Here we report the magnetic phase diagram for temperatures
above 2 K and applied magnetic fields below 9 T, characterized by measurements
of the magnetization and specific heat with field along the three unique
lattice directions. At low applied magnetic fields, the system first orders
magnetically below Tm1 ~ 21 K, and then shows a second magnetic phase
transition at Tm2 ~ 15 K. In addition, a phase transition that is apparent in
specific heat but not seen in magnetization is found for all three applied
field orientations, converging towards Tm2 as H -> 0. The magnetic behavior is
highly anisotropic, with critical fields for magnetic phase boundaries much
higher when the field is applied perpendicular to the Kagome staircase plane
than when applied in-plane. The field-temperature (H - T) phase diagrams are
quite rich, with 7 distinct phases observed.

L^2-Betti numbers of coamenable quantum groups,David Kyed,"  We prove that a compact quantum group is coamenable if and only if its
corepresentation ring is amenable. We further propose a Foelner condition for
compact quantum groups and prove it to be equivalent to coamenability. Using
this Foelner condition, we prove that for a coamenable compact quantum group
with tracial Haar state, the enveloping von Neumann algebra is dimension flat
over the Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients. This generalizes a theorem of
Lueck from the group case to the quantum group case, and provides examples of
compact quantum groups with vanishing L^2-Betti numbers.

"Can One Estimate The Unconditional Distribution of Post-Model-Selection
  Estimators?","Hannes Leeb, Benedikt M. Poetscher","  We consider the problem of estimating the unconditional distribution of a
post-model-selection estimator. The notion of a post-model-selection estimator
here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model
(e.g., by a model selection criterion like AIC or by a hypothesis testing
procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by
least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show
that it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution with
reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no
estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).
This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance
of estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by the
probability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold. These lower
bounds are shown to approach 1/2 or even 1 in large samples, depending on the
situation considered. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the
distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection
estimator.

Fixed Phase Quantum Search Algorithm,Ahmed Younes,"  Building quantum devices using fixed operators is a must to simplify the
hardware construction. Quantum search engine is not an exception. In this
paper, a fixed phase quantum search algorithm that searches for M matches in an
unstructured search space of size N will be presented. Selecting phase shifts
of 1.91684\pi in the standard amplitude amplification will make the technique
perform better so as to get probability of success at least 99.58% in
O(sqrt(N/M)) better than any know fixed operator quantum search algorithms. The
algorithm will be able to handle either a single match or multiple matches in
the search space. The algorithm will find a match in O(sqrt(N/M)) whether the
number of matches is known or not in advance.

Possible X-ray diagnostic for jet/disk dominance in Type 1 AGN,"Barbara J. Mattson, Kimberly A. Weaver and Christopher S. Reynolds","  Using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Seyfert 1 and 1.2 data spanning 9 years, we
study correlations between X-ray spectral features. The sample consists of 350
time-resolved spectra from 12 Seyfert 1 and 1.2 galaxies. Each spectrum is
fitted to a model with an intrinsic powerlaw X-ray spectrum produced close to
the central black hole that is reprocessed and absorbed by material around the
black hole. To test the robustness of our results, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations of the spectral sample. We find a complex relationship between the
iron line equivalent width (EW) and the underlying power law index (Gamma). The
data reveal a correlation between Gamma and EW which turns over at Gamma <~ 2,
but finds a weak anti-correlation for steeper photon indices. We propose that
this relationship is driven by dilution of a disk spectrum (which includes the
narrow iron line) by a beamed jet component and, hence, could be used as a
diagnostic of jet-dominance. In addition, our sample shows a strong correlation
between the reflection fraction (R) and Gamma, but we find that it is likely
the result of modeling degeneracies. We also see the X-ray Baldwin effect (an
anti-correlation between the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity and EW) for the sample
as a whole, but not for the individual galaxies and galaxy types.

On algebraic automorphisms and their rational invariants,Philippe Bonnet,"  Let X be an affine irreducible variety over an algebraically closed field k
of characteristic zero. Given an automorphism F, we denote by k(X)^F its field
of invariants, i.e. the set of rational functions f on X such that f(F)=f. Let
n(F) be the transcendence degree of k(X)^F over k. In this paper, we study the
class of automorphisms F of X for which n(F)= dim X - 1. More precisely, we
show that under some conditions on X, every such automorphism is of the form
F=A_g, where A is an algebraic action of a linear algebraic group G of
dimension 1 on X, and where g belongs to G. As an application, we determine the
conjugacy classes of automorphisms of the plane for which n(F)=1.

Improving immunization strategies,"Lazaros K. Gallos, Fredrik Liljeros, Panos Argyrakis, Armin Bunde, and
  Shlomo Havlin","  We introduce an immunization method where the percentage of required
vaccinations for immunity are close to the optimal value of a targeted
immunization scheme of highest degree nodes. Our strategy retains the advantage
of being purely local, without the need of knowledge on the global network
structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of
selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than
himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this
method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a
scale-free network model, and find it to be significantly more effective.

Constraints on the Very Early Universe from Thermal WIMP Dark Matter,"Manuel Drees, Hoernisa Iminniyaz, Mitsuru Kakizaki","  We investigate the relic density n_\chi of non-relativistic long-lived or
stable particles \chi in non-standard cosmological scenarios. We calculate the
relic abundance starting from arbitrary initial temperatures of the
radiation-dominated epoch, and derive the lower bound on the initial
temperature T_0 \geq m_\chi/23, assuming that thermally produced \chi particles
account for the dark matter energy density in the universe; this bound holds
for all \chi annihilation cross sections. We also investigate cosmological
scenarios with modified expansion rate. Even in this case an approximate
formula similar to the standard one is capable of predicting the final relic
abundance correctly. Choosing the \chi annihilation cross section such that the
observed cold dark matter abundance is reproduced in standard cosmology, we
constrain possible modifications of the expansion rate at T \sim m_\chi/20,
well before Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
"
Flavour-Dependent Type II Leptogenesis,Stefan Antusch,"  We reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest
right-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account
flavour-dependent effects. In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the
type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light
neutrinos is present. We consider type II seesaw scenarios where this
additional contribution arises from the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs
triplet, and furthermore an effective model-independent approach. We
investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of
the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early
universe, and compare them to the corresponding bounds in the type I seesaw
framework. We show that while flavour-dependent thermal type II leptogenesis
becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the
bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for leptogenesis becomes more
constrained. We also argue that in general, flavour-dependent effects cannot be
ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II seesaw models.

fine-scale structures that are found at the network boundaries and their

understanding their dynamics in different solar layers, as well as the role
such structures play in the mass balance and heating of the solar atmosphere.

"Orbital currents in the Colle-Salvetti correlation energy functional and
  the degeneracy problem","S. Pittalis, S. Kurth, S. Sharma, E.K.U. Gross","  Popular density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy typically
fail to reproduce the degeneracy of different ground states of open-shell
atoms. As a remedy, functionals which explicitly depend on the current density
have been suggested. We present an analysis of this problem by investigating
functionals that explicitly depend on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Going beyond the
exact-exchange approximation by adding correlation in the form of the
Colle-Salvetti functional we show how current-dependent terms enter the
Colle-Salvetti expression and their relevance is evaluated. A very good
description of the degeneracy of ground-states for atoms of the first and
second row of the periodic table is obtained.

Cooper pairs in atomic nuclei,"G. G. Dussel, S. Pittel, J. Dukelsky, and P. Sarriguren","  We consider the development of Cooper pairs in a self-consistent Hartree Fock
mean field for the even Sm isotopes. Results are presented at the level of a
BCS treatment, a number-projected BCS treatment and an exact treatment using
the Richardson ansatz. While projected BCS captures much of the pairing
correlation energy that is absent from BCS, it still misses a sizable
correlation energy, typically of order $1 MeV$. Furthermore, because it does
not average over the properties of the fermion pairs, the exact Richardson
solution permits a more meaningful definition of the Cooper wave function and
of the fraction of pairs that are collective.

Turbulence and the Navier-Stokes equations,R. M. Kiehn,"  The concept of continuous topological evolution, based upon Cartan's methods
of exterior differential systems, is used to develop a topological theory of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, within which there exist processes that exhibit
continuous topological change and thermodynamic irreversibility. The technique
furnishes a universal, topological foundation for the partial differential
equations of hydrodynamics and electrodynamics; the technique does not depend
upon a metric, connection or a variational principle. Certain topological
classes of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are shown to be equivalent
to thermodynamically irreversible processes.

Numerical estimation of critical parameters using the Bond entropy,Rafael A. Molina and Peter Schmitteckert,"  Using a model of spinless fermions in a lattice with nearest neighbor and
next-nearest neighbor interaction we show that the entropy of the reduced two
site density matrix (the bond entropy) can be used as an extremely accurate and
easy to calculate numerical indicator for the critical parameters of the
quantum phase transition when the basic ordering pattern has a two-site
periodicity. The actual behavior of the bond entropy depends on the particular
characteristics of the transition under study. For the Kosterlitz-Thouless type
phase transition from a Luttinger liquid phase to a charge density wave state
the bond entropy has a local maximum while in the transition from the Luttinger
liquid to the phase separated state the derivative of the bond entropy has a
divergence due to the cancelation of the third eigenvalue of the two-site
reduced density matrix.

Critical points for surface maps and the Benedicks-Carleson theorem,Hiroki Takahasi,"  We give an alternative proof of the Benedicks-Carleson theorem on the

definition of dynamically critical points. The argument is sufficiently general
and in particular applies to the case of non-invertible maps as well. It
naturally raises the question of an intrinsic characterization of dynamically
critical points for dissipative surface maps.

galaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the VVDS. We estimate the stellar mass
from broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy star
formation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to a
continuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)
stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population of
low-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3).
In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and more
significantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up to
z=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline with
redshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% for
M>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution
(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible
(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For less
massive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)
of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gas
into stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of their
assembly history below z=1. This fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. Low-mass
systems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor up
to 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assembly
also at z<1.

  Varner, K. Yamamoto","  Linear polarization in X- and gamma-rays is an important diagnostic of many
astrophysical sources, foremost giving information about their geometry,
magnetic fields, and radiation mechanisms. However, very few X-ray polarization
measurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilst
several objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.
In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarization
from cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular with
the proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We use
Geant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on Cygnus
X-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6
and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long duration
flight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of the
polarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signals
using chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,
for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component is
assumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made for
weaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can be
rejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%
polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%
polarization.

"Baryon Number-Induced Chern-Simons Couplings of Vector and Axial-Vector
  Mesons in Holographic QCD",Sophia K. Domokos and Jeffrey A. Harvey,"  We show that holographic models of QCD predict the presence of a Chern-Simons
coupling between vector and axial-vector mesons at finite baryon density. In
the AdS/CFT dictionary, the coefficient of this coupling is proportional to the
baryon number density, and is fixed uniquely in the five-dimensional
holographic dual by anomalies in the flavor currents. For the lightest mesons,
the coupling mixes transverse $\rho$ and $a_1$ polarization states. At
sufficiently large baryon number densities, it produces an instability, which
causes the $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons to condense in a state breaking both
rotational and translational invariance.

Total Quantum Zeno Effect beyond Zeno Time,"D. Mundarain, M. Orszag and J. Stephany","  In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in
an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The
effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose
appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the
initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that
there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the
system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states
are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the
electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.

Asteroseismic Signatures of Stellar Magnetic Activity Cycles,"T.S. Metcalfe, W.A. Dziembowski, P.G. Judge, M. Snow","  Observations of stellar activity cycles provide an opportunity to study
magnetic dynamos under many different physical conditions. Space-based
asteroseismology missions will soon yield useful constraints on the interior
conditions that nurture such magnetic cycles, and will be sensitive enough to
detect shifts in the oscillation frequencies due to the magnetic variations. We
derive a method for predicting these shifts from changes in the Mg II activity
index by scaling from solar data. We demonstrate this technique on the
solar-type subgiant beta Hyi, using archival International Ultraviolet Explorer
spectra and two epochs of ground-based asteroseismic observations. We find
qualitative evidence of the expected frequency shifts and predict the optimal
timing for future asteroseismic observations of this star.

Anomalous energy transport in the FPU-beta chain,"Jani Lukkarinen, Herbert Spohn","  We consider the energy current correlation function for the FPU-beta lattice.
For small non-linearity one can rely on kinetic theory. The issue reduces then
to a spectral analysis of the linearized collision operator. We prove thereby
that, on the basis of kinetic theory, the energy current correlations decay in
time as t^(-3/5). It follows that the thermal conductivity is anomalous,
increasing as N^(2/5) with the system size N.

allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many
other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes
Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical
emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and
X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main
peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt
emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from
1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The
optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather
than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED
shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour
might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities
similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The
afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.
Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are
consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is
the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a
combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of
2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame. A probable jet break is
detected at ~2x10^5s, leading to an estimate of ~10^51 erg for the
beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy.

Burgers Turbulence,Jeremie Bec and Konstantin Khanin,"  The last decades witnessed a renewal of interest in the Burgers equation.
Much activities focused on extensions of the original one-dimensional
pressureless model introduced in the thirties by the Dutch scientist J.M.
Burgers, and more precisely on the problem of Burgers turbulence, that is the
study of the solutions to the one- or multi-dimensional Burgers equation with
random initial conditions or random forcing. Such work was frequently motivated
by new emerging applications of Burgers model to statistical physics,
cosmology, and fluid dynamics. Also Burgers turbulence appeared as one of the
simplest instances of a nonlinear system out of equilibrium. The study of
random Lagrangian systems, of stochastic partial differential equations and
their invariant measures, the theory of dynamical systems, the applications of
field theory to the understanding of dissipative anomalies and of multiscaling
in hydrodynamic turbulence have benefited significantly from progress in
Burgers turbulence. The aim of this review is to give a unified view of
selected work stemming from these rather diverse disciplines.

"Analytical evaluation of the X-ray scattering contribution to imaging
  degradation in grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes",Daniele Spiga (INAF/Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera),"  The focusing performance of X-ray optics (conveniently expressed in terms of
HEW, Half Energy Width) strongly depend on both mirrors deformations and photon
scattering caused by the microroughness of reflecting surfaces. In particular,
the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually
an increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard
X-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),
the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also
in the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]
  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering
contribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in
terms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established
theory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the
basis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical
translation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice
versa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This
PSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the
H(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.
  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to
compute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the
PSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse
problem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror
surface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows
establishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given
H(E) requirement. [...]

Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the resulting spaces of test functions would
comply with the Hardy axiom only if classic results of Paley and Wiener, of

well, we point out several differences between the ``standard method'' of
constructing rigged Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics and the method used in
Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory.

Modelling the Galactic bar using OGLE-II Red Clump Giant Stars,"Nicholas J. Rattenbury, Shude Mao, Takahiro Sumi, Martin C. Smith","  Red clump giant stars can be used as distance indicators to trace the mass
distribution of the Galactic bar. We use RCG stars from 44 bulge fields from
the OGLE-II microlensing collaboration database to constrain analytic tri-axial
models for the Galactic bar. We find the bar major axis is oriented at an angle
of 24 - 27 degrees to the Sun-Galactic centre line-of-sight. The ratio of
semi-major and semi-minor bar axis scale lengths in the Galactic plane x_0,
y_0, and vertical bar scale length z_0, is x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 3.5 : 2.6,
suggesting a slightly more prolate bar structure than the working model of
Gerhard (2002) which gives the scale length ratios as x_0 : y_0 : z_0 = 10 : 4
: 3 .

"Dynamical Coupled-Channel Model of $\pi N$ Scattering in the W $\leq$ 2
  GeV Nucleon Resonance Region","B. Julia-Diaz, T.-S. H. Lee, A. Matsuyama, T. Sato","  As a first step to analyze the electromagnetic meson production reactions in
the nucleon resonance region, the parameters of the hadronic interactions of a
dynamical coupled-channel model, developed in {\it Physics Reports 439, 193
(2007)}, are determined by fitting the $\pi N$ scattering data. The channels
included in the calculations are $\pi N$, $\eta N$ and $\pi\pi N$ which has
$\pi\Delta$, $\rho N$, and $\sigma N$ resonant components. The non-resonant
meson-baryon interactions of the model are derived from a set of Lagrangians by
using a unitary transformation method. One or two bare excited nucleon states
in each of $S$, $P$, $D$, and $F$ partial waves are included to generate the
resonant amplitudes in the fits. The parameters of the model are first
determined by fitting as much as possible the empirical $\pi N$ elastic
scattering amplitudes of SAID up to 2 GeV. We then refine and confirm the
resulting parameters by directly comparing the predicted differential cross
section and target polarization asymmetry with the original data of the elastic
$\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$ and charge-exchange $\pi^- p \to \pi^0 n$
processes. The predicted total cross sections of $\pi N$ reactions and $\pi
N\to \eta N$ reactions are also in good agreement with the data. Applications
of the constructed model in analyzing the electromagnetic meson production data
as well as the future developments are discussed.

High-resolution study of a star-forming cluster in the Cep-A HW2 region,"C. Comito, P. Schilke, U. Endesfelder, I. Jimenez-Serra, J.
  Martin-Pintado","  Due to its relatively small distance (725 pc), the Cepheus A East
star-forming region is an ideal laboratory to study massive star formation
processes. Based on its morphology, it has been suggested that the flattened
molecular gas distribution around the YSO HW2 may be a 350-AU-radius massive
protostellar disk. Goal of our work is to ascertain the nature of this
structure. We have employed the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to acquire
(sub-)arcsecond-resolution imaging of high-density and shock tracers, such as
methyl cyanide (CH3CN) and silicon monoxide (SiO), towards the HW2 position. On
the 1-arcsecond (about 725 AU) scale, the flattened distribution of molecular
gas around HW2 appears to be due to the projected superposition, on the plane
of the sky, of at least three protostellar objects, of which at least one is
powering a molecular outflow at a small angle with respect to the line of
sight. The presence of a protostellar disk around HW2 is not ruled out, but
such structure is likely to be detected on a smaller spatial scale, or using
different molecular tracers.

"A Renormalization group approach for highly anisotropic 2D Fermion
  systems: application to coupled Hubbard chains",S. Moukouri,"  I apply a two-step density-matrix renormalization group method to the
anisotropic two-dimensional Hubbard model. As a prelude to this study, I
compare the numerical results to the exact one for the tight-binding model. I
find a ground-state energy which agrees with the exact value up to four digits
for systems as large as $24 \times 25$. I then apply the method to the
interacting case. I find that for strong Hubbard interaction, the ground-state
is dominated by magnetic correlations.
  These correlations are robust even in the presence of strong frustration.
Interchain pair tunneling is negligible in the singlet and triplet channels and
it is not enhanced by frustration. For weak Hubbard couplings, interchain
non-local singlet pair tunneling is enhanced and magnetic correlations are
strongly reduced. This suggests a possible superconductive ground state.

  Observations and Model Comparisons","Nicholas J. Rattenbury, Shude Mao, Victor P. Debattista, Takahiro
  Sumi, Ortwin Gerhard, Flavio De Lorenzi","  Red clump giants in the Galactic bulge are approximate standard candles and
hence they can be used as distance indicators. We compute the proper motion
dispersions of RCG stars in the Galactic bulge using the proper motion
catalogue from the second phase of the Optical Gravitational Microlensing
Experiment (OGLE-II, Sumi et al. 2004) for 45 fields. The proper motion
dispersions are measured to a few per cent accuracy due to the large number of
stars in the fields. The observational sample is comprised of 577736 stars.
These observed data are compared to a state-of-the-art particle simulation of
the Galactic bulge region. The predictions are in rough agreement with
observations, but appear to be too anisotropic in the velocity ellipsoid. We
note that there is significant field-to-field variation in the observed proper
motion dispersions. This could either be a real feature, or due to some unknown
systematic effect.

  size distribution and its moments","J.P. Wittmer, P. Beckrich, H. Meyer, A. Cavallo, A. Johner, J.
  Baschnagel","  Presenting theoretical arguments and numerical results we demonstrate
long-range intrachain correlations in concentrated solutions and melts of long
flexible polymers which cause a systematic swelling of short chain segments.
They can be traced back to the incompressibility of the melt leading to an
effective repulsion $u(s) \approx s/\rho R^3(s) \approx ce/\sqrt{s}$ when
connecting two segments together where $s$ denotes the curvilinear length of a
segment, $R(s)$ its typical size, $ce \approx 1/\rho be^3$ the ``swelling
coefficient"", $be$ the effective bond length and $\rho$ the monomer density.
The relative deviation of the segmental size distribution from the ideal
Gaussian chain behavior is found to be proportional to $u(s)$. The analysis of
different moments of this distribution allows for a precise determination of
the effective bond length $be$ and the swelling coefficient $ce$ of
asymptotically long chains. At striking variance to the short-range decay
suggested by Flory's ideality hypothesis the bond-bond correlation function of
two bonds separated by $s$ monomers along the chain is found to decay
algebraically as $1/s^{3/2}$. Effects of finite chain length are considered
briefly.

"Stability Properties of Strongly Magnetized Spine Sheath Relativistic
  Jets",Philip E Hardee,"  The linearized relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) equations describing a
uniform axially magnetized cylindrical relativistic jet spine embedded in a
uniform axially magnetized relativistically moving sheath are derived. The
displacement current is retained in the equations so that effects associated
with Alfven wave propagation near light speed can be studied. A dispersion
relation for the normal modes is obtained. Analytical solutions for the normal
modes in the low and high frequency limits are found and a general stability
condition is determined. A trans-Alfvenic and even a super-Alfvenic
relativistic jet spine can be stable to velocity shear driven Kelvin-Helmholtz
modes. The resonance condition for maximum growth of the normal modes is
obtained in the kinetically and magnetically dominated regimes. Numerical
solution of the dispersion relation verifies the analytical solutions and is
used to study the regime of high sound and Alfven speeds.

MATLAB codes for teaching quantum physics: Part 1,"Rafael Garcia (WPI), Alex Zozulya (WPI), James Stickney (WPI)","  Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course,
we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to

environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students
because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving
introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes
which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in
conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.

Nanodevices and Maxwell's Demon,Supriyo Datta,"  In the last twenty years there has been significant progress in our
understanding of quantum transport far from equilibrium and a conceptual
framework has emerged through a combination of the Landauer approach with the
non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method, which is now being widely used in
the analysis and design of nanoscale devices. It provides a unified description
for all kinds of devices from molecular conductors to carbon nanotubes to
silicon transistors covering different transport regimes from the ballistic to
the diffusive limit. In this talk I use a simple version of this model to
analyze a specially designed device that could be called an electronic
Maxwell's demon, one that lets electrons go preferentially in one direction
over another. My objective is to illustrate the fundamental role of contacts
and demons in transport and energy conversion. The discussion is kept at an
academic level steering clear of real world details, but the illustrative
devices we use are very much within the capabilities of present-day technology.
For example, recent experiments on thermoelectric effects in molecular
conductors agree well with the predictions from our model. The Maxwell's demon
device itself is very similar to the pentalayer spin-torque device which has
been studied by a number of groups though we are not aware of any discussion of
the possibility of using the device as a nanoscale heat engine or as a
refrigerator as proposed here. However, my objective is not to evaluate
possible practical applications. Rather it is to introduce a simple transparent
model showing how out-of-equibrium demons suitably incorporated into
nanodevices can achieve energy conversion.

Complete Segal spaces arising from simplicial categories,Julia E. Bergner,"  In this paper, we compare several functors which take simplicial categories

equivalence, of complete Segal spaces arising from these functors.

A Systematic Scan for 7-colourings of the Grid,"Markus Jalsenius, Kasper Pedersen","  We study the mixing time of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling from
the uniform distribution on proper 7-colourings of a finite rectangular
sub-grid of the infinite square lattice, the grid. A systematic scan Markov
chain cycles through finite-size subsets of vertices in a deterministic order
and updates the colours assigned to the vertices of each subset. The systematic
scan Markov chain that we present cycles through subsets consisting of 2x2
sub-grids and updates the colours assigned to the vertices using a procedure
known as heat-bath. We give a computer-assisted proof that this systematic scan
Markov chain mixes in O(log n) scans, where n is the size of the rectangular
sub-grid. We make use of a heuristic to compute required couplings of
colourings of 2x2 sub-grids. This is the first time the mixing time of a
systematic scan Markov chain on the grid has been shown to mix for less than 8
colours. We also give partial results that underline the challenges of proving
rapid mixing of a systematic scan Markov chain for sampling 6-colourings of the
grid by considering 2x3 and 3x3 sub-grids.

Magnetic exponents of two-dimensional Ising spin glasses,F. Liers and O. C. Martin,"  The magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional Ising spin glasses are
controversial. Using exact ground state determination, we extract the
properties of clusters flipped when increasing continuously a uniform field. We
show that these clusters have many holes but otherwise have statistical
properties similar to those of zero-field droplets. A detailed analysis gives
for the magnetization exponent delta = 1.30 +/- 0.02 using lattice sizes up to
80x80; this is compatible with the droplet model prediction delta = 1.282. The
reason for previous disagreements stems from the need to analyze both singular
and analytic contributions in the low-field regime.

"Thin elastic shells with variable thickness for lithospheric flexure of
  one-plate planets",Mikael Beuthe,"  Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.

valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a
single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In
this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this

electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in
the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin
flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a
range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we
find a reasonable agreement.

Donor type semiconductor at low temperature as maser active medium,Yuri Kornyushin,"  In some semiconductors donor impurity atoms can attract additional electrons,
forming negative donor impurity ions. Thus we have 3 energy levels for
electrons: zero energy levels at the bottom of the conductivity band, negative
energy levels of the bounded electrons of the negative donor impurity ions, and
deeper negative energy levels of the outer electrons of the neutral donor
impurity atoms. So the donor impurity atoms could serve as active centres for a
maser. The maximum achievable relative population is 0.5. Typical wavelength of
the generated oscillation is 0.14 mm; three level scheme could be realized at
rather low temperatures, considerably lower than 6 K.

subsequent to two remarkable events that were detected with Swift on 2006
September 21 from the candidate magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216: (1) a 20 ms
burst with an energy of 1e37 erg (15-150 keV), and (2) a rapid spin-down
(glitch) with a fractionap period change of 1e-4. We find that the luminosity
of the pulsar increased by a factor of 100 in the interval between
observations, from 1e33 to 1e35 erg/s (0.5-8.0 keV), and that its spectrum
hardened. The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), but
the fractional rms amplitude of the pulses decreased from 65 to 11 per cent,
and their profile changed from being single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks.
Similar changes have been observed from other magnetars in response to
outbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June. We suggest that a plastic
deformation of the neutron star's crust induced a very slight twist in the
external magnetic field, which in turn generated currents in the magnetosphere
that were the direct cause of the X-ray outburst.

"Further Evidence that the Redshifts of AGN Galaxies May Contain
  Intrinsic Components",M. B. Bell,"  In the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model galaxies are assumed to be
born as compact objects that have been ejected with large intrinsic redshift
components, z_(i), out of the nuclei of mature AGN galaxies. As young AGN
(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies
but their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and
they evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented
here that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to
radio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that
the high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been
pushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large
intrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =
0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in
luminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the
cosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to
be associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material
used to build galaxies. Whether it might be possible in the CR model to explain
these results by selection effects is also examined.

the distance to a random subset is $TP_2$ and $NSOP_1$. That example is the

through suitable spectral measure spaces.

Weak Amenability of Hyperbolic Groups,Narutaka Ozawa,"  We prove that hyperbolic groups are weakly amenable. This partially extends
the result of Cowling and Haagerup showing that lattices in simple Lie groups

spirit of Haagerup and prove that for the word length metric d on a hyperbolic
group, the Schur multipliers associated with r^d have uniformly bounded norms
for 0<r<1. We then combine this with a Bozejko-Picardello type inequality to
obtain weak amenability.

"Light Curves of Dwarf Plutonian Planets and other Large Kuiper Belt
  Objects: Their Rotations, Phase Functions and Absolute Magnitudes",Scott S. Sheppard,"  (Abridged) I report new light curves and determine the rotations and phase
functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, including the dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313). (120348) 2004 TY364 shows a light curve which if double-peaked
has a period of 11.70+-0.01 hours and peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22+-0.02
magnitudes. (84922) 2003 VS2 has a well defined double-peaked light curve of

variability of 0.21+-0.04 magnitudes with a possible 13.25+-0.2 hour
single-peaked period. The seven new KBOs in the sample which show no
discernible variations within the uncertainties on short rotational time scales
are 2001 UQ18, (55565) 2002 AW197, (119979) 2002 WC19, (120132) 2003 FY128,
(136108) Eris 2003 UB313, (90482) Orcus 2004 DW, and (90568) 2004 GV9. The
three medium to large sized Kuiper Belt objects 2004 TY364, Orcus and 2004 GV9
show fairly steep linear phase curves (~0.18 to 0.26 mags per degree) between
phase angles of 0.1 and 1.5 degrees. The extremely large dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313) shows a shallower phase curve (0.09+-0.03 mags per degree) which
is more similar to the other known dwarf planet Pluto. It appears the surface
properties of the largest dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt maybe different than
the smaller Kuiper Belt objects. This may have to do with the larger objects
ability to hold more volatile ices as well as sustain atmospheres. The absolute
magnitudes obtained using the measured phase slopes are a few tenths of
magnitudes different from those given by the MPC.

Fischler-Susskind holographic cosmology revisited,"Pablo Diaz, M. A. Per, Antonio Segui","  When Fischler and Susskind proposed a holographic prescription based on the
Particle Horizon, they found that spatially closed cosmological models do not
verify it due to the apparently unavoidable recontraction of the Particle
Horizon area. In this article, after a short review of their original work, we
expose graphically and analytically that spatially closed cosmological models
can avoid this problem if they expand fast enough. It has been also shown that
the Holographic Principle is saturated for a codimension one brane dominated
Universe. The Fischler-Susskind prescription is used to obtain the maximum
number of degrees of freedom per Planck volume at the Planck era compatible
with the Holographic Principle.

argued that the scenario with the scalar gravitons filling up the Universe may
emulate the LCDM model, reducing thus the true dark matter to an artefact.

Parity doubling in particle physics,S. S. Afonin,"  Parity doubling in excited hadrons is reviewed. Parity degeneracy in hadrons
was first experimentally observed 40 years ago. Recently new experimental data
on light mesons caused much excitement and renewed interest to the phenomenon,
which still remains to be enigmatic. The present retrospective review is an
attempt to trace the history of parity doubling phenomenon, thus providing a
kind of introduction to the subject. We begin with early approaches of 1960s
(Regge theory and dynamical symmetries) and end up with the latest trends
(manifestations of broader degeneracies and AdS/QCD). We show the evolution of
various ideas about parity doubling. The experimental evidence for this
phenomenon is scrutinized in the non-strange sector. Some experiments of 1960s
devoted to the search for missing non-strange bosons are re-examined and it is
argued that results of these experiments are encouraging from the modern
perspective.

Bergman kernels and equilibrium measures for ample line bundles,Robert Berman,"  Let L be an ample holomorphic line bundle over a compact complex Hermitian

the corresponding Bergman kernels. The convergence is studied in the large k
limit and is expressed in terms of the equilibrium metric associated to the
fixed metric, as well as in terms of the Monge-Ampere measure of the fixed
metric itself on a certain support set. It is also shown that the equilibrium
metric has Lipschitz continuous first derivatives. These results can be seen as
generalizations of well-known results concerning the case when the curvature of
the fixed metric is positive (the corresponding equilibrium metric is then
simply the fixed metric itself).

U Geminorum: a test case for orbital parameters determination,"J. Echevarria (1), E. de la Fuente (2), R. Costero (1) ((1) IA UNAM,
  Mexico, (2) Departamento de Fisica, CUCEI, Universidad de Guadalajara,
  Mexico)","  High-resolution spectroscopy of U Gem was obtained during quiescence. We did
not find a hot spot or gas stream around the outer boundaries of the accretion
disk. Instead, we detected a strong narrow emission near the location of the
secondary star. We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of the
double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value that
is in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in the
ultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new method
to obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission features
arising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with published
values derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison of
the TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit is
obtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at that
spectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflect
accurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =
107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given by
Zhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =
1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun. Based
on the separation of the double emission peaks, we calculate an outer disk
radius of R_out/a ~0.61, close to the distance of the inner Lagrangian point
L_1/a~0.63. Therefore we suggest that, at the time of observations, the
accretion disk was filling the Roche-Lobe of the primary, and that the matter
leaving the L_1 point was colliding with the disc directly, producing the hot
spot at this location.

"Collective excitations of hard-core Bosons at half filling on square and
  triangular lattices: Development of roton minima and collapse of roton gap",Tyler Bryant and Rajiv R. P. Singh,"  We study ground state properties and excitation spectra for hard-core Bosons
on square and triangular lattices, at half filling, using series expansion
methods. Nearest-neighbor repulsion between the Bosons leads to the development
of short-range density order at the antiferromagnetic wavevector, and
simultaneously a roton minima in the density excitation spectra. On the
square-lattice, the model maps on to the well studied XXZ model, and the roton
gap collapses to zero precisely at the Heisenberg symmetry point, leading to
the well known spectra for the Heisenberg antiferromagnet. On the
triangular-lattice, the collapse of the roton gap signals the onset of the
supersolid phase. Our results suggest that the transition from the superfluid
to the supersolid phase maybe weakly first order. We also find several features
in the density of states, including two-peaks and a sharp discontinuity, which
maybe observable in experimental realization of such systems.

Circulating Current States in Bilayer Fermionic and Bosonic Systems,Alexei Kolezhuk,"  It is shown that fermionic polar molecules or atoms in a bilayer optical

Non-Relativistic Propagators via Schwinger's Method,"A. Aragao, H. Boschi-Filho, C. Farina and F.A. Barone","  In order to popularize the so called Schwinger's method we reconsider the
Feynman propagator of two non-relativistic systems: a charged particle in a
uniform magnetic field and a charged harmonic oscillator in a uniform magnetic
field. Instead of solving the Heisenberg equations for the position and the
canonical momentum operators, ${\bf R}$ and ${\bf P}$, we apply this method by
solving the Heisenberg equations for the gauge invariant operators ${\bf R}$
and $\mathversion{bold}${\pi}$ = {\bf P}-e{\bf A}$, the latter being the
mechanical momentum operator. In our procedure we avoid fixing the gauge from
the beginning and the result thus obtained shows explicitly the gauge
dependence of the Feynman propagator.

"How much entropy is produced in strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma
  (sQGP) by dissipative effects?",Michael Lublinsky and Edward Shuryak,"  We argue that estimates of dissipative effects based on the first-order
hydrodynamics with shear viscosity are potentially misleading because higher
order terms in the gradient expansion of the dissipative part of the stress
tensor tend to reduce them. Using recently obtained sound dispersion relation
in thermal $\cal N$=4 supersymmetric plasma, we calculate the $resummed$ effect
of these high order terms for Bjorken expansion appropriate to RHIC/LHC
collisions. A reduction of entropy production is found to be substantial, up to
an order of magnitude.

Spectral Analysis of the Chandra Comet Survey,"D. Bodewits, D.J. Christian, M. Torney, M. Dryer, C.M. Lisse, K.
  Dennerl, T.H. Zurbuchen, S.J. Wolk, A.G.G.M. Tielens, and R. Hoekstra","  We present results of the analysis of cometary X-ray spectra with an extended
version of our charge exchange emission model (Bodewits et al. 2006). We have
applied this model to the sample of 8 comets thus far observed with the Chandra
X-ray observatory and ACIS spectrometer in the 300-1000 eV range. The surveyed
comets are C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley), C/2000 WM1
(LINEAR), 153P/2002 (Ikeya-Zhang), 2P/2003 (Encke), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), 9P/2005
(Tempel 1) and 73P/2006-B (Schwassmann-Wachmann 3) and the observations include
a broad variety of comets, solar wind environments and observational
conditions. The interaction model is based on state selective, velocity
dependent charge exchange cross sections and is used to explore how cometary
X-ray emission depend on cometary, observational and solar wind
characteristics. It is further demonstrated that cometary X-ray spectra mainly
reflect the state of the local solar wind. The current sample of Chandra
observations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, and
relative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Our
analysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solar
wind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,
(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated with
interplanetary coronal mass ejections. We furthermore predict the existence of
a fourth spectral class, associated with the cool, fast high latitude wind.

"Correlations, fluctuations and stability of a finite-size network of
  coupled oscillators",Michael A. Buice and Carson C. Chow,"  The incoherent state of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators exhibits
marginal modes in mean field theory. We demonstrate that corrections due to
finite size effects render these modes stable in the subcritical case, i.e.
when the population is not synchronous. This demonstration is facilitated by
the construction of a non-equilibrium statistical field theoretic formulation
of a generic model of coupled oscillators. This theory is consistent with
previous results. In the all-to-all case, the fluctuations in this theory are
due completely to finite size corrections, which can be calculated in an
expansion in 1/N, where N is the number of oscillators. The N -> infinity limit
of this theory is what is traditionally called mean field theory for the
Kuramoto model.
"
Route to Lambda in conformally coupled phantom cosmology,"Orest Hrycyna, Marek Szydlowski","  In this letter we investigate acceleration in the flat cosmological model
with a conformally coupled phantom field and we show that acceleration is its
generic feature. We reduce the dynamics of the model to a 3-dimensional
dynamical system and analyze it on a invariant 2-dimensional submanifold. Then
the concordance FRW model with the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is a global
attractor situated on a 2-dimensional invariant space. We also study the
behaviour near this attractor, which can be approximated by the dynamics of the
linearized part of the system. We demonstrate that trajectories of the
conformally coupled phantom scalar field with a simple quadratic potential
crosses the cosmological constant barrier infinitely many times in the phase
space. The universal behaviour of the scalar field and its potential is also
calculated. We conclude that the phantom scalar field conformally coupled to
gravity gives a natural dynamical mechanism of concentration of the equation of
state coefficient around the magical value $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$. We demonstrate
route to Lambda through the infinite times crossing the $w_{\text{eff}}=-1$
phantom divide.
"
Interaction of Supernova Ejecta with Nearby Protoplanetary Disks,"N. Ouellette, S. J. Desch and J. J. Hester","  The early Solar System contained short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe (t1/2
= 1.5 Myr) whose most likely source was a nearby supernova. Previous models of
Solar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapse
of the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,
that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a very
close (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.
We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questions
related to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a close
supernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulations
demonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock to
escape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass loss
occur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of the
disk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. These
low efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that the
high disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the disk
before stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to be
consistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. On
the other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed into
dust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will be
injected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoritic
abundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore are
consistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1
pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.

"Scaling cosmologies, geodesic motion and pseudo-susy","Wissam Chemissany, Andr\'e ploegh, Thomas Van Riet","  One-parameter solutions in supergravity carried by scalars and a metric trace
out curves on the scalar manifold. In ungauged supergravity these curves
describe a geodesic motion. It is known that a geodesic motion sometimes occurs
in the presence of a scalar potential and for time-dependent solutions this can
happen for scaling cosmologies. This note contains a further study of such
solutions in the context of pseudo-supersymmetry for multi-field systems whose
first-order equations we derive using a Bogomol'nyi-like method. In particular
we show that scaling solutions that are pseudo-BPS must describe geodesic
curves. Furthermore, we clarify how to solve the geodesic equations of motion
when the scalar manifold is a maximally non-compact coset such as occurs in
maximal supergravity. This relies upon a parametrization of the coset in the
Borel gauge. We then illustrate this with the cosmological solutions of
higher-dimensional gravity compactified on a $n$-torus.

"The Peculiar Velocities of Local Type Ia Supernovae and their Impact on
  Cosmology","James D. Neill (1), Michael J. Hudson (2), and Alex Conley (3) ((1)
  California Institute of Technology, (2) University of Waterloo, (3)
  University of Toronto)","  We quantify the effect of supernova Type Ia peculiar velocities on the
derivation of cosmological parameters. The published distant and local Ia SNe
used for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form the
sample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe are
at rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption by
applying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three different
flow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, have
varying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMB
frame. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda using
flatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examine
the effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The most
favored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly better
than the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocity
studies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derive
the largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiar
velocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error is
Delta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is Delta
Omega_m < +0.01. The favored flow model (beta=0.5) produces the following
cosmological parameters: w = -1.08 (+0.09,-0.08), Omega_m = 0.27 (+0.02,-0.02)
assuming a flat cosmology, and Omega_Lambda = 0.80 (+0.08,-0.07) and Omega_m =
0.27 (+0.02,-0.02) for a w = -1 (LambdaCDM) cosmology.

Creation of Quark-gluon Plasma in Celestial Laboratories,R. K. Thakur,"  It is shown that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as an ultrahigh

inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when the energy
E of the particles comprising the matter in the black hole is $ \sim 10^{2} $

"Temperature-driven transition from the Wigner Crystal to the
  Bond-Charge-Density Wave in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Quarter-Filled band","R.T. Clay, R.P. Hardikar, S. Mazumdar","  It is known that within the interacting electron model Hamiltonian for the
one-dimensional 1/4-filled band, the singlet ground state is a Wigner crystal
only if the nearest neighbor electron-electron repulsion is larger than a
critical value. We show that this critical nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction
is different for each spin subspace, with the critical value decreasing with
increasing spin. As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there can
occur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierls
state that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different from
the Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations from
the spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied by
changes in site charge densities. We apply our theory to the 1/4-filled band
quasi-one-dimensional organic charge-transfer solids in general and to 2:1
tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene
(TMTSF) cationic salts in particular. We believe that many recent experiments
strongly indicate the Wigner crystal to Bond-Charge-Density Wave transition in
several members of the TMTTF family. We explain the occurrence of two different
antiferromagnetic phases but a single spin-Peierls state in the generic phase
diagram for the 2:1 cationic solids. The antiferromagnetic phases can have
either the Wigner crystal or the Bond-Charge-Spin-Density Wave charge
occupancies. The spin-Peierls state is always a Bond-Charge-Density Wave.

Bubbling Surface Operators And S-Duality,Jaume Gomis and Shunji Matsuura,"  We construct smooth asymptotically AdS_5xS^5 solutions of Type IIB
supergravity corresponding to all the half-BPS surface operators in N=4 SYM.
All the parameters labeling a half-BPS surface operator are identified in the
corresponding bubbling geometry. We use the supergravity description of surface
operators to study the action of the SL(2,Z) duality group of N=4 SYM on the
parameters of the surface operator, and find that it coincides with the recent
proposal by Gukov and Witten in the framework of the gauge theory approach to
the geometrical Langlands with ramification. We also show that whenever a
bubbling geometry becomes singular that the path integral description of the
corresponding surface operator also becomes singular.

Resolving Cosmic Gamma Ray Anomalies with Dark Matter Decaying Now,"Jose A. R. Cembranos, Jonathan L. Feng, Louis E. Strigari","  Dark matter particles need not be completely stable, and in fact they may be
decaying now. We consider this possibility in the frameworks of universal extra
dimensions and supersymmetry with very late decays of WIMPs to Kaluza-Klein
gravitons and gravitinos. The diffuse photon background is a sensitive probe,
even for lifetimes far greater than the age of the Universe. Remarkably, both
the energy spectrum and flux of the observed MeV gamma ray excess may be
naturally explained by decaying dark matter with MeV mass splittings. Future
observations of continuum and line photon fluxes will test this explanation and
may provide novel constraints on cosmological parameters.

Neutrino-cooled accretion and GRB variability,Dimitrios Giannios (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics),"  For accretion rates Mdot~0.1 Msun/s to a few solar mass black hole the inner
part of the disk is expected to make a transition from advection dominance to
neutrino cooling. This transition is characterized by sharp changes of the disk
properties. I argue here that during this transition, a modest increase of the
accretion rate leads to powerful enhancement of the Poynting luminosity of the
GRB flow and decrease of its baryon loading. These changes of the
characteristics of the GRB flow translate into changing gamma-ray spectra from
the photosphere of the flow. The photospheric interpretation of the GRB
emission explains the observed narrowing of GRB pulses with increasing photon
energy and the luminosity-spectral peak relation within and among bursts.

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) sample obtained from the first epoch data of the
VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line AGN
with redshift up to z=5 and 17.5< I <24.0, selected on the basis of their
spectra. In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical Luminosity
Function up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results with
previous results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Our
data, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow us
to constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. By
combining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extracted
from the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of different
evolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents the
combined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, is
a luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derived
from the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of the
AGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains the
excess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model we
find, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, that
the peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshift
going to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number of
X-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of ""AGN cosmic
downsizing"", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated to
more massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, than
that of low luminosity ones.
"
Can a Black Hole Collapse to a Space-time Singularity?,R. K. Thakur,"  A critique of the singularity theorems of Penrose, Hawking, and Geroch is
given. It is pointed out that a gravitationally collapsing black hole acts as
an ultrahigh energy particle accelerator that can accelerate particles to
energies inconceivable in any terrestrial particle accelerator, and that when
the energy $E$ of the particles comprising matter in a black hole is $\sim
10^{2} GeV$ or more, or equivalently, the temperature $T$ is $\sim 10^{15} K$
or more, the entire matter in the black hole is converted into quark-gluon
plasma permeated by leptons. As quarks and leptons are fermions, it is
emphasized that the collapse of a black-hole to a space-time singularity is
inhibited by Pauli's exclusion principle. It is also suggested that ultimately
a black hole may end up either as a stable quark star, or as a pulsating quark
star which may be a source of gravitational radiation, or it may simply explode
with a mini bang of a sort.

Dynamics of single polymers under extreme confinement,"Armin Rahmani, Claudio Castelnovo, Jeremy Schmit and Claudio Chamon","  We study the dynamics of a single chain polymer confined to a two dimensional
cell. We introduce a kinetically constrained lattice gas model that preserves
the connectivity of the chain, and we use this kinetically constrained model to
study the dynamics of the polymer at varying densities through Monte Carlo
simulations. Even at densities close to the fully-packed configuration, we find
that the monomers comprising the chain manage to diffuse around the box with a
root mean square displacement of the order of the box dimensions over time
scales for which the overall geometry of the polymer is, nevertheless, largely
preserved. To capture this shape persistence, we define the local tangent field
and study the two-time tangent-tangent correlation function, which exhibits a
glass-like behavior. In both closed and open chains, we observe reptational
motion and reshaping through local fingering events which entail global monomer
displacement.

"Diffuse Optical Light in Galaxy Clusters II: Correlations with Cluster
  Properties",J. E. Krick and R. A. Bernstein,"  We have measured the flux, profile, color, and substructure in the diffuse
intracluster light (ICL) in a sample of ten galaxy clusters with a range of
mass, morphology, redshift, and density. Deep, wide-field observations for this
project were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and
analysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point
spread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in
both bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11}
h^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar
luminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total
cluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the
B-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution
corrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group
environments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the
cluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is
incomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,
low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high
flux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations
between ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do
find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally
concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is
consistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or
forming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.

approached the relational concept in third-person perspective (ontic level). It
is possible to deduce different physical consequence and interpretation through
first-person perspective approach. This relational interpretation leave open
the questions: i)we must abandon the idea for a physical system the possibility
to extract completeness information? ii)we must abandon the idea to infer a

Ultraviolet Observations of Supernovae,Nino Panagia,"  The motivations to make ultraviolet (UV) studies of supernovae (SNe) are
reviewed and discussed in the light of the results obtained so far by means of
IUE and HST observations. It appears that UV studies of SNe can, and do lead to
fundamental results not only for our understanding of the SN phenomenon, such
as the kinematics and the metallicity of the ejecta, but also for exciting new
findings in Cosmology, such as the tantalizing evidence for ""dark energy"" that
seems to pervade the Universe and to dominate its energetics. The need for
additional and more detailed UV observations is also considered and discussed.

Stochastic fluctuations in metabolic pathways,Erel Levine and Terence Hwa,"  Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its
growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or
transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels
of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to
investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks.
Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly inter-linked,
and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the
analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the
exactly soluable linear queueing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer
system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the
abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic
network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in
different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently,
fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate
elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely
shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study
metabolic networks with more complex topologies, or protein signaling networks
which are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for
bioinformatic analysis of metabolimic data are discussed.

effects of dynamical environment on planet formation and evolution.
  Aims. Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellar
metallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searched
for close-in planets using the transit technique.
  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\'artir telescope (2.1m),
and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probability
we also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observational
campaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetary
transits was achieved.
  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791
be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailed
simulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do not
confirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). The
probability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence is
estimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.
  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:
(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smaller
planetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)
limitations in the basic assumptions. More extensive photometry with 3-4m class
telescopes is required to allow conclusive inferences about the frequency of
planets in NGC 6791.

Possible polarisation and spin dependent aspects of quantum gravity,"D. V. Ahluwalia-Khalilova, N. G. Gresnigt, Alex B. Nielsen, D.
  Schritt, T. F. Watson (University of Canterbury, New Zealand)","  We argue that quantum gravity theories that carry a Lie algebraic
modification of the Poincare' and Heisenberg algebras inevitably provide
inhomogeneities that may serve as seeds for cosmological structure formation.
Furthermore, in this class of theories one must expect a strong polarisation
and spin dependence of various quantum-gravity effects.

On the support genus of a contact structure,Mehmet Firat Arikan,"  The algorithm given by Akbulut-Ozbagci constructs an explicit open book
decomposition on a contact three-manifold described by a contact surgery on a
link in the three-sphere. In this article, we will improve this algorithm by
using Giroux's contact cell decomposition process. Our algorithm is more
economical on choosing the supporting genus of the open book; in particular it
gives a good upper bound for the recently defined ``minimal supporting genus
invariant'' of contact structures.

Very Massive Stars in High-Redshift Galaxies,"Mark Dijkstra, Stuart Wyithe (Melbourne)","  A significant fraction of Lyman Alpha (Lya) emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z>
5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) greater than ~100 Angstrom. However
only a small fraction of the Lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmitted
through the IGM, which implies intrinsic Lya EWs that are in excess of the
maximum allowed for a population-II stellar population having a Salpeter mass
function. In this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering Lya
emission in high redshift galaxies. We propose a simple model for Lya emitters
in which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results
in a large intrinsic EW, followed by a phase of population-II star formation
with a lower EW. We confront this model with a range of high redshift
observations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe the
following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population with
plausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of star
formation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,
v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies at
z=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) the
observed correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that the
observed anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of very
massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the
galaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicate
the presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-drop
galaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.

Holographic formula for Q-curvature,C. Robin Graham and Andreas Juhl,"  This paper derives an explicit formula for Branson's Q-curvature in
even-dimensional conformal geometry. The ingredients in the formula come from
the Poincare metric in one higher dimension; hence the formula is called
holographic. When specialized to the conformally flat case, the holographic
formula expresses Q-curvature as a multiple of the Pfaffian and the divergence
of a natural one-form. The paper also outlines the relation between holographic
formulae for Q-curvature and a new theory of conformally covariant families of
differential operators due to the second author.

The azimuth structure of nuclear collisions -- I,Thomas A. Trainor and David T. Kettler,"  We describe azimuth structure commonly associated with elliptic and directed
flow in the context of 2D angular autocorrelations for the purpose of precise
separation of so-called nonflow (mainly minijets) from flow. We extend the
Fourier-transform description of azimuth structure to include power spectra and
autocorrelations related by the Wiener-Khintchine theorem. We analyze several
examples of conventional flow analysis in that context and question the
relevance of reaction plane estimation to flow analysis. We introduce the 2D
angular autocorrelation with examples from data analysis and describe a
simulation exercise which demonstrates precise separation of flow and nonflow
using the 2D autocorrelation method. We show that an alternative correlation
measure based on Pearson's normalized covariance provides a more intuitive
measure of azimuth structure.
"
Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery,Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina Lerman,"  Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that
require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.

Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr,"Kristina Lerman, Anon Plangprasopchok and Chio Wong","  The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate
them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by
adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or
searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a
specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an
insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not
relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in
the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this
metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search
performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision
by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network
that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic
model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics
contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be
described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics
found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding
images on topics that are of interest to the user.

Resummed Cross Section for Jet Production at Hadron Colliders,Daniel de Florian and Werner Vogelsang,"  We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the
single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we
address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming
partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final
state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to
depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at
threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which
most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results
to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive
resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present
numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.

Settling the Complexity of Computing Two-Player Nash Equilibria,"Xi Chen, Xiaotie Deng, Shang-Hua Teng","  We settle a long-standing open question in algorithmic game theory. We prove
that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game,
is complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed
version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.
  This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash
equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:
  Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless
every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity
of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for
Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in
randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest
form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are
polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have
two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations
research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix
Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming
unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.

"Equation of State in Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics: variable versus
  constant adiabatic index",A. Mignone and Jonathan C. McKinney,"  The role of the equation of state for a perfectly conducting, relativistic
magnetized fluid is the main subject of this work. The ideal constant
$\Gamma$-law equation of state, commonly adopted in a wide range of
astrophysical applications, is compared with a more realistic equation of state
that better approximates the single-specie relativistic gas. The paper focus on
three different topics. First, the influence of a more realistic equation of
state on the propagation of fast magneto-sonic shocks is investigated. This
calls into question the validity of the constant $\Gamma$-law equation of state
in problems where the temperature of the gas substantially changes across
hydromagnetic waves. Second, we present a new inversion scheme to recover
primitive variables (such as rest-mass density and pressure) from conservative
ones that allows for a general equation of state and avoids catastrophic
numerical cancellations in the non-relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits.
Finally, selected numerical tests of astrophysical relevance (including
magnetized accretion flows around Kerr black holes) are compared using
different equations of state. Our main conclusion is that the choice of a
realistic equation of state can considerably bear upon the solution when
transitions from cold to hot gas (or viceversa) are present. Under these
circumstances, a polytropic equation of state can significantly endanger the
solution.

"Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Field Emitting Diode: Understanding the System
  Response Based on Multiphysics Modeling","N. Sinha, D. Roy Mahapatra, J.T.W. Yeow, R.V.N. Melnik, D.A. Jaffray","  In this paper, we model the evolution and self-assembly of randomly oriented
carbon nanotubes (CNTs), grown on a metallic substrate in the form of a thin
film for field emission under diode configuration. Despite high output, the
current in such a thin film device often decays drastically. The present paper
is focused on understanding this problem. A systematic, multiphysics based
modelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model for
degradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed to
decay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of the
CNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain the
self-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical force
are employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current at
the device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation and
integration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. The
simulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results. Based
on the developed model, numerical simulations aimed at understanding the
effects of various geometric parameters and their statistical features on the
device current history are reported.
"
Demographics of Transition Objects,"Joan R. Najita, Stephen E. Strom, and James Muzerolle","  The unusual properties of transition objects (young stars with an optically
thin inner disc surrounded by an optically thick outer disc) suggest that
significant disc evolution has occured in these systems. We explore the nature
of these systems by examining their demographics, specifically their stellar
accretion rates (Mdot) and disc masses (Mdisc) compared to those of accreting T
Tauri stars of comparable age. We find that transition objects in Taurus occupy
a restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transition
single stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically
~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.
These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theories
and suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significant
role in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects. Considering
transition objects as a distinct demographic group among accreting T Tauri
stars leads to a tighter relationship between disc masses and stellar accretion
rates, with a slope between the two quantities that is close to the value of
unity expected in simple theories of disc accretion.

"Modeling the Field Emission Current Fluctuation in Carbon Nanotube Thin
  Films","N. Sinha, D. Roy Mahapatra, J.T.W. Yeow, R.V.N. Melnik","  Owing to their distinct properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have emerged as
promising candidate for field emission devices. It has been found
experimentally that the results related to the field emission performance show
variability. The design of an efficient field emitting device requires the
analysis of the variabilities with a systematic and multiphysics based modeling
approach. In this paper, we develop a model of randomly oriented CNTs in a thin
film by coupling the field emission phenomena, the electron-phonon transport
and the mechanics of single isolated CNT. A computational scheme is developed
by which the states of CNTs are updated in time incremental manner. The device
current is calculated by using Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission to
study the performance at the device scale.

given.

undergoing massive star formation (MSF). To investigate their role as an
evolutionary tracer, we have recently completed a large observing program with
the ATCA to derive the dynamical and physical properties of molecular/ionised
gas towards a sample of MSF regions traced by 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission.
We find that the molecular gas in many of these regions breaks up into multiple
sub-clumps which we separate into groups based on their association
with/without methanol maser and cm continuum emission. The temperature and
dynamic state of the molecular gas is markedly different between the groups.
Based on these differences, we attempt to assess the evolutionary state of the
cores in the groups and thus investigate the role of class II methanol masers
as a tracer of MSF.

"Effect of atomic beam alignment on photon correlation measurements in
  cavity QED",L. Horvath and H. J. Carmichael,"  Quantum trajectory simulations of a cavity QED system comprising an atomic
beam traversing a standing-wave cavity are carried out. The delayed photon
coincident rate for forwards scattering is computed and compared with the
measurements of Rempe et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 1727 (1991)] and Foster et
al. [Phys. Rev. A 61, 053821 (2000)]. It is shown that a moderate atomic beam
misalignment can account for the degradation of the predicted correlation. Fits
to the experimental data are made in the weak-field limit with a single
adjustable parameter--the atomic beam tilt from perpendicular to the cavity
axis. Departures of the measurement conditions from the weak-field limit are
discussed.

systematic depletion with increasing degree of disorder, and recovered with
increasing temperature. Altshuler-Aronov (AA) theory of disordered metals well
explains the dependences of the experimental results. Scaling analysis of the

Some Properties of and Open Problems on Hessian Nilpotent Polynomials,Wenhua Zhao,"  In the recent progress [BE1], [M], [Z1] and [Z2], the well-known Jacobian
conjecture ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a problem on HN (Hessian nilpotent)
polynomials (the polynomials whose Hessian matrix are nilpotent) and their
(deformed) inversion pairs. In this paper, we prove several results on HN
polynomials, their (deformed) inversion pairs as well as the associated
symmetric polynomial or formal maps. We also propose some open problems for
further study of these objects.

Two Results on Homogeneous Hessian Nilpotent Polynomials,Arno van den Essen and Wenhua Zhao,"  Let $z=(z_1, ..., z_n)$ and $\Delta=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac {\partial^2}{\partial
z^2_i}$ the Laplace operator. A formal power series $P(z)$ is said to be {\it
Hessian Nilpotent}(HN) if its Hessian matrix $\Hes P(z)=(\frac {\partial^2
P}{\partial z_i\partial z_j})$ is nilpotent. In recent developments in [BE1],
[M] and [Z], the Jacobian conjecture has been reduced to the following
so-called {\it vanishing conjecture}(VC) of HN polynomials: {\it for any
homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ $($of degree $d=4$$)$, we have $\Delta^m
P^{m+1}(z)=0$ for any $m>>0$.} In this paper, we first show that, the VC holds
for any homogeneous HN polynomial $P(z)$ provided that the projective
subvarieties ${\mathcal Z}_P$ and ${\mathcal Z}_{\sigma_2}$ of $\mathbb C
P^{n-1}$ determined by the principal ideals generated by $P(z)$ and
$\sigma_2(z):=\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^2$, respectively, intersect only at regular
points of ${\mathcal Z}_P$. Consequently, the Jacobian conjecture holds for the
symmetric polynomial maps $F=z-\nabla P$ with $P(z)$ HN if $F$ has no non-zero
fixed point $w\in \mathbb C^n$ with $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2=0$. Secondly, we show
that the VC holds for a HN formal power series $P(z)$ if and only if, for any
polynomial $f(z)$, $\Delta^m (f(z)P(z)^m)=0$ when $m>>0$.

"A Vanishing Conjecture on Differential Operators with Constant
  Coefficients",Wenhua Zhao,"  In the recent progress [BE1], [Me] and [Z2], the well-known JC (Jacobian
conjecture) ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a VC (vanishing conjecture) on the
Laplace operators and HN (Hessian nilpotent) polynomials (the polynomials whose
Hessian matrix are nilpotent). In this paper, we first show that the vanishing
conjecture above, hence also the JC, is equivalent to a vanishing conjecture
for all 2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$ and
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials $P$ (the polynomials $P(z)$ satisfying
$\Lambda^m P^m=0$ for all $m\ge 1$). We then transform some results in the
literature on the JC, HN polynomials and the VC of the Laplace operators to
certain results on $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials and the associated VC for
2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$. This part of the paper
can also be read as a short survey on HN polynomials and the associated VC in
the more general setting. Finally, we discuss a still-to-be-understood
connection of $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials in general with the classical
orthogonal polynomials in one or more variables. This connection provides a
conceptual understanding for the isotropic properties of homogeneous
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials for the 2nd order homogeneous full rank
differential operators $\Lambda$ with constant coefficients.

"Effects of accelerating growth on the evolution of weighted complex
  networks","Zhongzhi Zhang, Lujun Fang, Shuigeng Zhou, and Jihong Guan","  Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of
edges grows faster than the network size. In this paper, we propose a simple
weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical
expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and
weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that
accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks.
Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a
transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect
to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the
theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical
simulations.

explicitly that the $N_p N_n$ scheme for the excitation energy emerges from the
separate exponential dependence of the excitation energy on the valence nucleon
numbers $N_p$ and $N_n$ together with the fact that only a limited set of
numbers is allowed for the $N_p$ and $N_n$ of the existing nuclei.

"Locally Decodable Codes From Nice Subsets of Finite Fields and Prime
  Factors of Mersenne Numbers","Kiran S. Kedlaya, Sergey Yekhanin","  A k-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes an n-bit message x as an N-bit
codeword C(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bit x_i of the
message by querying only k bits of the codeword C(x), even after some constant
fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted. The major goal of LDC related
research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query
complexity of such codes.
  Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable
codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is
based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue
that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number
theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne
numbers.
  Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime
factor p>m^\gamma yields a family of k(\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of
length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \epsilon > 0 one
can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length
Exp(n^\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger
than known currently.

"Effect of the Spatial Dispersion on the Shape of a Light Pulse in a
  Quantum Well","L. I. Korovin, I. G. Lang, S. T. Pavlov","  Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, the
carrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitions
in a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well are
assumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into
account. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length of
the light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,
and the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on
the light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and
quantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an
arbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic
excitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the
shapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when the
radiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interband
transitions taken into account.

the first Brillouin zone was studied by means of angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). The temperature T* above which the pseudogap structure in
the ARPES spectrum disappears was found to have an R dependence that is
opposite to that ofthe superconducting transition temperature Tc. This
indicates that the pseudogap state is competing with high-Tc superconductivity,
and the large Tc suppression observed with increasing the out-of-plane disorder
is due to the stabilization of the pseudogap state.

Retract rationality and Noether's problem,Ming-chang Kang,"  Let K be any field and G be a finite group. We will prove that, if K is any

"Very High Energy Gamma Rays from Supernova Remnants and Constraints on
  the Galactic Interstellar Radiation Field","T. A. Porter, I. V. Moskalenko, and A. W. Strong","  The large-scale Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) is the result of
stellar emission and dust re-processing of starlight. Where the energy density
of the ISRF is high (e.g., the Galactic Centre), the dominant gamma-ray
emission in individual supernova remnants (SNRs), such as G0.9+0.1, may come
from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the ISRF. Several models of the ISRF
exist. The most recent one, which has been calculated by us, predicts a
significantly higher ISRF than the well-used model of Mathis, Mezger, and
Panagia. However,comparison with data is limited to local observations. Based
on our current estimate of the ISRF we predict the gamma-ray emission in the
SNRs G0.9+0.1 and RXJ1713, and pair-production absorption features above 20 TeV
in the spectra of G0.9+0.1, J1713-381, and J1634-472. We discuss how GLAST,
along with current and future very high energy instruments, may be able to
provide upper bounds on the large-scale ISRF.

"Magneto-oscillations due to electron-electron interactions in the ac
  conductivity of a 2D electron gas",T. A. Sedrakyan and M. E. Raikh,"  Electron-electron interactions give rise to the correction,
\delta\sigma^{int}(\omega), to the ac magnetoconductivity, \sigma(\omega), of a
clean 2D electron gas that is periodic in \omega_c^{-1}, where \omega_c is the
cyclotron frequency. Unlike conventional harmonics of the cyclotron resonance,
which are periodic with \omega, this correction is periodic with \omega^{3/2}.
Oscillations in \delta\sigma^{int}(\omega) develop at low magnetic fields,
\omega_c\ll\omega, when the conventional harmonics are suppressed by the
disorder. Their origin is a {\em double} backscattering of an electron from the
impurity-induced Friedel oscillations. During the time \sim\omega^{-1} between
the two backscattering events the electron travels only a {\em small portion}
of the Larmour circle.

Optimal fluctuation approach to a directed polymer in a random medium,I.V. Kolokolov and S.E. Korshunov,"  A modification of the optimal fluctuation approach is applied to study the
tails of the free energy distribution function P(F) for an elastic string in
quenched disorder both in the regions of the universal behavior of P(F) and in
the regions of large fluctuations, where the behavior of P(F) is non-universal.
The difference between the two regimes is shown to consist in whether it is
necessary or not to take into account the renormalization of parameters by the
fluctuations of disorder in the vicinity of the optimal fluctuation.

"Implementation of a Gauss convoluted Pandel PDF for track reconstruction
  in Neutrino Telescopes","N. van Eijndhoven, O. Fadiran and G. Japaridze","  A probability distribution function is presented which provides a realistic
description of the detection of scattered photons. The resulting probabilities
can be described analytically by means of a superposition of several special
functions. These exact expressions can be evaluated numerically only for small
distances and limited time residuals, due to computer accuracy limitations. In
this report we provide approximations for the exact expressions in different
regions of the distance-time residual space, defined by the detector geometry
and the space-time scale of an event. These approximations can be evaluated
numerically with a relative error with respect to the exact expression at the
boundaries of less than 0.001.

"A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Logic: Extended
  Version",Linda Buisman and Rajeev Gor\'e,"  Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a
connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by
Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her
subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by
Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for
BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics.
Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and
its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus
handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from
premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed
derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be
used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.

"From virtual work principle to least action principle for stochastic

mechanical system from the principle of virtual work, i.e., the virtual work of
microscopic forces on the elements of a mechanical system vanishes in
thermodynamic equilibrium, we present in this paper an application of the same
principle to dynamical systems out of equilibrium. The aim of this work is to
justify a least action principle and the concurrent maximum path entropy
principle for nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems.

"Further Analysis of Excitations of Quarks at Finite Temperature -- Mass
  Effect and Pole Structure --","Kazuya Mitsutani, Masakiyo Kitazawa, Teiji Kunihiro, Yukio Nemoto","  We calculate the spectral function of the massive quark at finite temperature
(T) using a Yukawa model and show that the peak in the negative energy region
among the three-peaks found in a previous work for the massless quark is
largely suppressed. To explore the underlying mechanism of this behavior, we
also investigate the pole structure of the retarded Green function of the
quark. We will show the result only for the massless quark. We find the
residues of the poles corresponding the three-peaks are all comparable at
$T\sim m_b$. We also show that the multi-peak structure of the quark spectra is
well described in the pole approximation which indicates that the quasi-paricle
picture is valid in this $T$ region.

characterize its equilibriums and possible trajectories. The theoretical

Borromean Entanglement Revisited,Ayumu Sugita,"  An interesting analogy between quantum entangled states and topological links
was suggested by Aravind. In particular, he emphasized a connection between the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and the Borromean rings. However, he
made the connection in a way that depends on the choice of measurement basis.
We reconsider it in a basis-independent way by using the reduced density
matrix.

An SiO Maser Search off the Galactic Plane,"S. Deguchi, T. Fujii, Y. Ita, H. Imai, H. Izumiura, O. Kameya, N.
  Matsunaga, A. Miyazaki, A. Mizutani, Y. Nakada, J. Nakashima, A. Winnberg","  We have searched for the SiO J=1--0 v= 1 and 2 maser lines at ~ 43 GHz in 277
2MASS/MSX/IRAS sources off the Galactic plane (|b|> 3 deg), which resulted in
119 (112 new) detections. Among the new detections, are two very faint objects
with MSX 12 micron flux densities below 2 Jy. These are likely to be O-rich
AGB-stars associated with dwarf-galaxy tidal tails. The sample also includes
medium bright MSX objects at moderately high Galactic latitudes (3 deg<|b|<5
deg) and in the IRAS gap at higher latitudes. A signature of a warp of the
inner Galactic disk is found for a disk subsample. This warp appears relatively
strongly in the area of 0<l<45 deg and 3<|b|<5 deg. We also found a group of
stars that does not follow to the Galactic rotation. This feature appears in
the Galactic disk at l~ 27 deg, and extends more than 15 deg in Galactic
latitude, like a stream of tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy.
"
Dislocation Dynamics in a Crystal Lattice (Peierls-Nabarro) Relief,B. V. Petukhov,"  The theory of the dislocation motion in the periodic potential relief of the
crystal lattice (the Peierls-Nabarro barriers) is reviewed. On the basis of the
kink mechanism the temperature dependence of the flow stress is described for a
wide class of materials. The theory of quantum mechanical dislocation
tunnelling through the Peierls-Nabarro barriers is extended and compared with
experimental data on the plasticity of alkali halides, BCC and HCP metals at
low temperatures. The behavior of the flow stress at the range of athermic
anomalies is modeled by changing the mechanism of the dislocation motion from
the thermally activated hopping over the barriers to the quantum tunnelling
through them. Some results of previous calculations are represented in a more
explicit convenient for applications form. The pronounced effect of the
switching between the normal and the superconducting states on the flow stress
of metals is explained on the basis of the change in the dissipative properties
of the electron subsystem affecting the dislocation motion.
"
"Spectrum of cosmic rays, produced in supernova remnants","E.G.Berezhko, H.J.Voelk","  Nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova
remnants is employed to calculate CR spectra. The magnetic field in SNRs is
assumed to be significantly amplified by the efficiently accelerating nuclear
CR component. It is shown that the calculated CR spectra agree in a
satisfactory way with the existing measurements up to the energy $10^{17}$ eV.
The power law spectrum of protons extends up to the energy $3\times 10^{15}$ eV
with a subsequent exponential cutoff. It gives a natural explanation for the
observed knee in the Galactic CR spectrum. The maximum energy of the
accelerated nuclei is proportional to their charge number $Z$. Therefore the
break in the Galactic CR spectrum is the result of the contribution of
progressively heavier species in the overall CR spectrum so that at $10^{17}$
eV the CR spectrum is dominated by iron group nuclei. It is shown that this
component plus a suitably chosen extragalactic CR component can give a
consistent description for the entire Galactic CR spectrum.

One-parameter families of functions in the Pick class,Waldemar Paluba,"  In the one-parameter family of power-law maps of the form
$f_a(x)=-|x|^{\alpha}+a,$ $\alpha >1,$ we give examples of mutually related
dynamically determined quantities, depending on the parameter $a$, such that
one is a Pick function of the following one. These Pick functions are
extendable by reflection through the $(1,+\infty)$ half-axis and have
completely monotone derivatives there.

The homology of the Steinberg variety and Weyl group coinvariants,J. Matthew Douglass and Gerhard Roehrle,"  Let G be a complex, connected, reductive algebraic group with Weyl group W

algebra of W.
"
Spin-spin Correlation in Some Excited States of Transverse Ising Model,"Anjan Kumar Chandra, Subinay Dasgupta","  We consider the transverse Ising model in one dimension with
nearest-neighbour interaction and calculate exactly the longitudinal spin-spin
correlation for a class of excited states. These states are known to play an
important role in the perturbative treatment of one-dimensional transverse
Ising model with frustrated second-neighbour interaction. To calculate the
correlation, we follow the earlier procedure of Wu, use Szego's theorem and
also use Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. The result is that the correlation decays
algebraically with distance ($n$) as $1/\surd n$ and is oscillatory or
non-oscillatory depending on the magnitude of the transverse field.

"Radiative quarkonium decays and the NMSSM Higgs interpretation of the
  HyperCP Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events",Michelangelo L. Mangano and Paolo Nason,"  We study the potential of radiative decays of the Upsilon(1S) and of the phi
mesons to search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson, proposed as a possible
interpretation of Sigma+ --> p mu+mu- events observed by the HyperCP
collaboration at Fermilab. We conclude that the detection of this signal should
certainly be possible with the current CLEO Upsilon(1S) data, and is within the
reach of KLOE in at least part of the range of couplings suggested by the
HyperCP findings.
"
"A resummed perturbative estimate for the quarkonium spectral function in
  hot QCD",M. Laine,"  By making use of the finite-temperature real-time static potential that was
introduced and computed to leading non-trivial order in Hard Thermal Loop
resummed perturbation theory in recent work, and solving numerically a
Schr\""odinger-type equation, we estimate the quarkonium (in practice,
bottomonium) contribution to the spectral function of the electromagnetic
current in hot QCD. The spectral function shows a single resonance peak which
becomes wider and then disappears as the temperature is increased beyond 450
MeV or so. This behaviour can be compared with recently attempted lattice
reconstructions of the same quantity, based on the ``maximum entropy method'',
which generically show several peaks. We also specify the dependence of our
results on the spatial momentum of the electromagnetic current, as well as on
the baryon chemical potential characterising the hot QCD plasma.

An Exotic Approach to Hadron Physics,"Masako Bando, Yoko Fukase, Jonathan Shock, Akio Sugamoto, Sachiko
  Terunuma","  An exotic approach to hadrons is discussed. It is based on the recently
developed open-closed string duality explicitly conjectured as the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Mesons as well as pentaquarks are studied in this approach.
Spins are introduced as distribution functions over the string, and a second
quantization method of string theory is examined and used to estimate the mass
and decay width of various hadrons. This approach provides a way to understand
the structure of flavor by a configuration of probe branes.

"Fermi Surface Reconstruction without Breakdown of Kondo Screening at
  Quantum Critical Point",Hiroshi Watanabe and Masao Ogata,"  Motivated by recent Hall-effect experiment in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, we study ground
state properties of a Kondo lattice model in a two-dimensional square lattice
using variational Monte Carlo method. We show that there are two types of phase
transition, antiferromagnetic transition and topological one (Fermi surface
reconstruction). In a wide region of parameters, these two transitions occur
simultaneously without the breakdown of Kondo screening, accompanied by a
discontinuous change of the Hall coefficient. This result is consistent with
the experiment and gives a novel theoretical picture for the quantum critical
point in heavy fermion systems.

A User-Friendly Code to Diagnose Chromospheric Plasmas,"A. Asensio Ramos (1), J. Trujillo Bueno (1,2) ((1) IAC, (2) CSIC)","  The physical interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of lines of
neutral helium, such as those of the 10830 A multiplet, represents an excellent
opportunity for investigating the magnetism of plasma structures in the solar
chromosphere. Here we present a powerful forward modeling and inversion code
that permits either to calculate the emergent intensity and polarization for
any given magnetic field vector or to infer the dynamical and magnetic
properties from the observed Stokes profiles. This diagnostic tool is based on
the quantum theory of spectral line polarization, which self-consistently
accounts for the Hanle and Zeeman effects in the most general case of the
incomplete Paschen-Back effect regime. We also take into account radiative
transfer effects. An efficient numerical scheme based on global optimization
methods has been applied. Our Stokes inversion code permits a fast and reliable
determination of the global minimum.

Inhomogeneous color superconductivity and the cooling of compact stars,M. Ruggieri,"  In this talk I discuss the inhomogeneous (LOFF) color superconductive phases

"
Scaling anomaly in cosmic string background,Pulak Ranjan Giri,"  We show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic
string background is broken upon inequivalent quantization of the classical
system, leading to anomaly. The consequence of this anomaly is the formation of
single bound state in the coupling interval \gamma\in(-1,1). The inequivalent
quantization is characterized by a 1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension
parameter \omega. It has been conjectured that the formation of loosely bound
state in cosmic string background may lead to the so called anomalous
scattering cross section for the particles, which is usually seen in molecular
physics.

"On de Broglie's quantum particle as the soliton solution of linear
  Schr\""odinger equation",Agung Budiyono,"  We develop a class of soliton solution of {\it linear} Schr\""odinger equation
without external potential. The quantum probability density generates its own
boundary inside which there is internal vibration whose wave number is
determined by the velocity of the particle as firstly conjectured by de
Broglie. Assuming resonance of the internal vibration will lead to quantization
of particle's momentum in term of wave number of the envelope quantum
probability density. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\""odinger
equation allows us to have non-interacting many solitons solution through
superposition, each describing a particle with equal mass.

"Stringy corrections to a time-dependent background solution of string
  and M-Theory",Gustavo Niz and Neil Turok,"  We consider one of the simplest time-dependent backgrounds in M-theory,
describing the shrinking away of the M-theory dimension with the other spatial
dimensions static. As the M-theory dimension becomes small, the situation
becomes well-described by string theory in a singular cosmological background
where the string coupling tends to zero but the $\alpha'$-corrections become
large, near the cosmic singularity. We compute these $\alpha'$-corrections,
both for the background and for linearized perturbations, in heterotic string
theory, and show they may be reproduced by a map from eleven-dimensional
M-theory.
"
Doubly Special Relativity and Finsler geometry,S. Mignemi,"  We discuss the recent proposal of implementing Doubly Special Relativity in
configuration space by means of Finsler geometry. Although this formalism leads
to a consistent description of the dynamics of a particle, it does not seem to
give a complete description of the physics. In particular, the Finsler line
element is not invariant under the deformed Lorentz transformations of Doubly
Special Relativity. We study in detail some simple applications of the
formalism.

"The Sedentary Survey of Extreme High Energy Peaked BL Lacs III. Results
  from Optical Spectroscopy","S. Piranomonte, M. Perri, P. Giommi, H. Landt, P. Padovani","  The multi-frequency Sedentary Survey is a flux limited, statistically
well-defined sample of highly X-ray dominated BL Lacertae objects (HBLs) which
includes 150 sources. In this paper, the third of the series, we report the
results of a dedicated optical spectroscopy campaign that, together with
results from other independent optical follow up programs, led to the
spectroscopic identification of all sources in the sample. We carried out a
systematic spectroscopic campaign for the observation of all unidentified
objects of the sample using the ESO 3.6m, the KPNO 4m, and the TNG optical
telescopes. We present new identifications and optical spectra for 76 sources,
50 of which are new BL Lac objects, 18 are sources previously referred as BL
Lacs but for which no redshift information was available, and 8 are broad
emission lines AGNs. We find that the multi-frequency selection technique used
to build the survey is highly efficient (about 90%) in selecting BL Lacs
objects. We present positional and spectroscopic information for all confirmed
BL Lac objects. Our data allowed us to determined 36 redshifts out of the 50
new BL Lacs and 5 new redshifts for the previously known objects. The redshift
distribution of the complete sample is presented and compared with that of
other BL Lacs samples. For 26 sources without recognizable absorption features,
we calculated lower limits to the redshift using a method based on simulated
optical spectra with different ratios between jet and galaxy emission. For a
subsample of 38 object with high-quality spectra, we find a correlation between
the optical spectral slope, the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity, and the Ca H&K break
value, indicating that for powerful/beamed sources the optical light is
dominated by the non-thermal emission from the jet.
"
Latin bitrades derived from groups,"Nicholas J. Cavenagh, Ales Drapal, and Carlo Hamalainen","  A latin bitrade is a pair of partial latin squares which are disjoint, occupy
the same set of non-empty cells, and whose corresponding rows and columns
contain the same set of entries. Dr\'apal (\cite{Dr9}) showed that a latin
bitrade is equivalent to three derangements whose product is the identity and
whose cycles pairwise have at most one point in common. By letting a group act
on itself by right translation, we show how some latin bitrades may be derived
from groups without specifying an independent group action. Properties of latin
trades such as homogeneousness, minimality (via thinness) and orthogonality may
also be encoded succinctly within the group structure. We apply the
construction to some well-known groups, constructing previously unknown latin
bitrades. In particular, we show the existence of minimal, $k$-homogeneous
latin trades for each odd $k\geq 3$. In some cases these are the smallest known
such examples.
"
Wormholes in the accelerating universe,"Pedro F Gonzalez-Diaz and Prado Martin-Moruno (IMAFF, CSIC)","  We discuss different arguments that have been raised against the viability of
the big trip process, reaching the conclusions that this process can actually
occur by accretion of phantom energy onto the wormholes and that it is stable
and might occur in the global context of a multiverse model. We finally argue
that the big trip does not contradict any holographic bounds on entropy and
information.

"Spheroidal and torsional modes of quasistatic shear oscillations in the
  solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics","S. Bastrukov, H-K. Chang, S. Misicu, I. Molodtsova, D. Podgainy","  The past three decades of investigation on nuclear physics and pulsar
astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the
continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic
motions of degenerate Fermi-matter constituting interior of the nuclear
material objects, the densest of all known today. This paper focuses on one
theoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory
behavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic,
force-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature
compared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in
this case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and
torsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be
unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking
advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method
is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar
astrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic
Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density,
the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

Extra force in $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity,"Orfeu Bertolami, Christian G. Boehmer, Tiberiu Harko, Francisco S.N.
  Lobo","  The equation of motion for test particles in $f(R)$ modified theories of
gravity is derived. By considering an explicit coupling between an arbitrary
function of the scalar curvature, $R$, and the Lagrangian density of matter, it
is shown that an extra force arises. This extra force is orthogonal to the
four-velocity and the corresponding acceleration law is obtained in the weak
field limit. Connections with MOND and with the Pioneer anomaly are further
discussed.
"
Averaging and Cosmological Observations,A.A. Coley,"  The gravitational field equations on cosmological scales are obtained by
averaging the Einstein field equations of general relativity. By assuming
spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales, the local
inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction (backreaction) terms,
which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the
Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker models. The effects of averaging on
cosmological observations are discussed. It is argued that, based on estimates
from observational data, the backreaction (and, in particular, the averaged
spatial curvature) can have a very significant dynamical effect on the
evolution of the Universe and must be taken into account in observational
cosmology.
"
Calorimetry of Bose-Einstein condensates,"P. B. Blakie, E. Toth, M. J. Davis","  We outline a practical scheme for measuring the thermodynamic properties of a
Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of internal energy. We propose using
Bragg scattering and controlled trap manipulations to impart a precise amount
of energy to a near zero temperature condensate. After thermalisation the
temperature can be measured using standard techniques to determine the state
equation $T(U,N,\omega)$. Our analysis accounts for interaction effects and the
excitation of constants of motion which restrict the energy available for
thermalisation.
"
Parallelizing Quantum Circuits,Anne Broadbent and Elham Kashefi,"  We present a novel automated technique for parallelizing quantum circuits via
forward and backward translation to measurement-based quantum computing
patterns and analyze the trade off in terms of depth and space complexity. As a
result we distinguish a class of polynomial depth circuits that can be
parallelized to logarithmic depth while adding only polynomial many auxiliary
qubits. In particular, we provide for the first time a full characterization of
patterns with flow of arbitrary depth, based on the notion of influencing paths
and a simple rewriting system on the angles of the measurement. Our method
leads to insightful knowledge for constructing parallel circuits and as
applications, we demonstrate several constant and logarithmic depth circuits.
Furthermore, we prove a logarithmic separation in terms of quantum depth
between the quantum circuit model and the measurement-based model.

Quantum memory for images - a quantum hologram,"Denis V. Vasilyev, Ivan V. Sokolov, and Eugene S. Polzik","  Matter-light quantum interface and quantum memory for light are important
ingredients of quantum information protocols, such as quantum networks,
distributed quantum computation, etc. In this Letter we present a spatially
multimode scheme for quantum memory for light, which we call a quantum
hologram. Our approach uses a multi-atom ensemble which has been shown to be
efficient for a single spatial mode quantum memory. Due to the multi-atom
nature of the ensemble it is capable of storing many spatial modes, a feature
critical for the present proposal. A quantum hologram has a higher storage
capacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantum
features of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantum
states, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to optical
parallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviously
exceed that of a single-mode scheme.

Financial time-series analysis: A brief overview,"A. Chakraborti, M. Patriarca, and M.S. Santhanam","  Prices of commodities or assets produce what is called time-series. Different
kinds of financial time-series have been recorded and studied for decades.
Nowadays, all transactions on a financial market are recorded, leading to a
huge amount of data available, either for free in the Internet or commercially.
Financial time-series analysis is of great interest to practitioners as well as
to theoreticians, for making inferences and predictions. Furthermore, the
stochastic uncertainties inherent in financial time-series and the theory
needed to deal with them make the subject especially interesting not only to
economists, but also to statisticians and physicists. While it would be a
formidable task to make an exhaustive review on the topic, with this review we
try to give a flavor of some of its aspects.

"Integral representations for solutions of exponential Gauss-Manin
  systems","Marco Hien, Celine Roucairol","  Let f,g be two algebraically independent regular functions from the smooth
affine complex variety U to the affine line. The associated exponential
Gauss-Manin systems on the affine line are defined to be the cohomology sheaves
of the direct image of the exponential differential system $\mathcal{O}_U e^g $
with respect to f. We prove that its holomorphic solutions admit
representations in terms of period integrals over topological chains with
possibly closed support and with rapid decay condition.

Charged current deep-inelastic scattering at three loops,S. Moch and M. Rogal,"  We derive for deep-inelastic neutrino-proton scattering in the combination nu
P - nubar P the perturbative QCD corrections to three loops for the charged
current structure functions F_2, F_L and F_3. In leading twist approximation we
calculate the first five odd-integer Mellin moments in the case of F_2 and F_L
and the first five even-integer moments in the case of F_3. As a new result we
obtain the coefficient functions to O(alpha_s^3) while the corresponding
anomalous dimensions agree with known results in the literature.

"Detection of a 1258 Hz high-amplitude kilohertz quasi-periodic
  oscillation in the ultra-compact X-ray binary 1A 1246-588","P.G. Jonker, J.J.M. in 't Zand, M. Mendez, M. van der Klis","  We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report the
discovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. The
kilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux state
reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single
trial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequency
have only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequency
is higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, strongly
suggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found in
LMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence the
highest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpc
from a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistent
flux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one of
the weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. The
root-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, this
is the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the general
anti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertz
QPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce a
colour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides further
evidence for the atoll nature of the source.
"
Surface gap solitons at a nonlinearity interface,Tomas Dohnal and Dmitry Pelinovsky,"  We demonstrate existence of waves localized at the interface of two nonlinear
periodic media with different coefficients of the cubic nonlinearity via the
one-dimensional Gross--Pitaevsky equation. We call these waves the surface gap
solitons (SGS). In the case of smooth symmetric periodic potentials, we study
analytically bifurcations of SGS's from standard gap solitons and determine
numerically the maximal jump of the nonlinearity coefficient allowing for the
SGS existence. We show that the maximal jump vanishes near the thresholds of
bifurcations of gap solitons. In the case of continuous potentials with a jump
in the first derivative at the interface, we develop a homotopy method of
continuation of SGS families from the solution obtained via gluing of parts of
the standard gap solitons and study existence of SGS's in the photonic band
gaps. We explain the termination of the SGS families in the interior points of
the band gaps from the bifurcation of linear bound states in the continuous
non-smooth potentials.

presented for the frequency of morphological types and mean colours in the
catalogue. A visual inspection of the images reveals that the rate of
interacting galaxies in the local Universe is approximately 1.5% in the
$r\le16$ sample. A verification is made for the photometric catalogue generated
by the SDSS, especially as to its bright end completeness.

Blazar surveys with WMAP and Swift,"P. Giommi, M. Capalbi, E. Cavazzuti, S. Colafrancesco, S. Cutini, D.
  Gasparrini, E. Massaro, P. Padovani, M. Perri, S. Puccetti","  We present the preliminary results from two new surveys of blazars that have
direct implications on the GLAST detection of extragalactic sources from two
different perspectives: microwave selection and a combined deep X-ray/radio
selection. The first one is a 41 GHz flux-limited sample extracted from the
WMAP 3-yr catalog of microwave point sources. This is a statistically well
defined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are
expected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of
Blazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with
serendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on
the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is
particularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased
as GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray
band (\fx \simgt $10^{-15}$ \ergs) with a position accuracy of a few
arc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky,
d) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making
it approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about
one order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of
radio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of
unresolved GLAST high latitude gamma-ray background and its anisotropy
spectrum.

I. The mass gap and solution of the quark confinement problem in QCD,V. Gogokhia,"  Using the previously derived confining gluon propagator, the corresponding
system of equations determining the quark propagator is derived. The system of
equations consists of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator
itself, which includes the zero momentum transfer quark-gluon vertex. It is
complemented by the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this vertex. The quark equation
depends explicitly on the mass gap, determining the scale of the truly
nonperturbative dynamics in the QCD ground state. The obtained system of
equations is manifestly gauge-invariant, i.e., does not depend explicitly on
the gauge-fixing parameter. It is also free from all the types of the
perturbative contributions (""contaminations""), which may appear at the
fundamental quark-gluon level.

Tunnelling from black holes and tunnelling into white holes,"Bhramar Chatterjee, A. Ghosh and P. Mitra","  Hawking radiation is nowadays being understood as tunnelling through black
hole horizons. Here, the extension of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to
tunnelling for non-rotating and rotating black holes in different non-singular
coordinate systems not only confirms this quantum emission from black holes but
also reveals the new phenomenon of absorption into white holes by quantum
mechanical tunnelling. The role of a boundary condition of total absorption or
emission is also clarified.

Solving algebraic equations in roots of unity,Iskander Aliev and Chris Smyth,"  This paper is devoted to finding solutions of polynomial equations in roots
of unity. It was conjectured by S. Lang and proved by M. Laurent that all such
solutions can be described in terms of a finite number of parametric families
called maximal torsion cosets. We obtain new explicit upper bounds for the
number of maximal torsion cosets on an algebraic subvariety of the complex
algebraic $n$-torus ${\mathbb G}_{\rm m}^n$. In contrast to earlier works that
give the bounds of polynomial growth in the maximum total degree of defining
polynomials, the proofs of our results are constructive. This allows us to
obtain a new algorithm for determining maximal torsion cosets on an algebraic
subvariety of ${\mathbb G}_{\rm m}^n$.
"
Self-Organization applied to Dynamic Network Layout,Markus M. Geipel,"  As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a
strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge
by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
""attractive and repulsive forces"". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.

+ instrument -- for the broad band filters U, B, V, R, I, and z for each of its
four quadrants. Those measurements can also be downloaded from the public VIMOS

Searches for Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies in Galaxy Groups,"E.A. Evstigneeva, M.J. Drinkwater, R. Jurek, P. Firth, J.B. Jones,
  M.D. Gregg, S. Phillipps","  We present the results of a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in
six different galaxy groups: Dorado, NGC1400, NGC0681, NGC4038, NGC4697 and
NGC5084. We searched in the apparent magnitude range 17.5 < b_j < 20.5 (except
NGC5084: 19.2 < b_j < 21.0). We found 1 definite plus 2 possible UCD candidates
in the Dorado group and 2 possible UCD candidates in the NGC1400 group. No UCDs
were found in the other groups. We compared these results with predicted
luminosities of UCDs in the groups according to the hypothesis that UCDs are
globular clusters formed in galaxies. The theoretical predictions broadly agree
with the observational results, but deeper surveys are needed to fully test the
predictions.
"
Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities,Olivier Rioul,"  While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the
basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's
covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy
power.

"Van der Waals interaction between a microparticle and a single-wall
  carbon nanotube","E.V. Blagov, G.L. Klimchitskaya, V.M. Mostepanenko","  The Lifshitz-type formulas describing the free energy and the force of the
van der Waals interaction between an atom (molecule) and a single-wall carbon
nanotube are obtained. The single-wall nanotube is considered as a cylindrical
sheet carrying a two-dimensional free electron gas with appropriate boundary
conditions on the electromagnetic field. The obtained formulas are used to
calculate the van der Waals free energy and force between a hydrogen atom
(molecule) and single-wall carbon nanotubes of different radia. Comparison
studies of the van der Waals interaction of hydrogen atoms with single- and
multi-wall carbon nanotubes show that depending on atom-nanotube separation
distance the idealization of graphite dielectric permittivity is already
applicable to nanotubes with only two or three walls.
"
Relativistic corrections for two- and three-body flux tube model,"F. Buisseret, C. Semay","  We generalize the relativistic flux tube model for arbitrary two- or
three-body systems. The spin-independent and spin-dependent contributions of
the flux tube to the total Hamiltonian are computed in perturbation. In
particular, we show that the spin-dependent part exhibits a universal
spin-orbit form: It does not depend on the nature of the confined particles.
The general equations we present, being well-defined for light particles, can
thus be applied to usual as well as exotic hadrons such as hybrid mesons and
glueballs.

The No-Broadcasting Theorem and its Classical Counterpart,A. Kalev and I. Hen,"  Although it is widely accepted that `no-broadcasting' -- the nonclonability
of quantum information -- is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, an
impossibility theorem for the broadcasting of general density matrices has not
yet been formulated. In this paper, we present a general proof for the
no-broadcasting theorem, which applies to arbitrary density matrices. The proof
relies on entropic considerations, and as such can also be directly linked to
its classical counterpart, which applies to probabilistic distributions of
statistical ensembles.

Quantum random walks and vanishing of the second Hochschild cohomology,Debashish Goswami and Lingaraj Sahu,"  Given a conditionally completely positive map $\mathcal L$ on a unital

Hochschild cohomology of $\A$ with coefficients in the bimodule $E_{\mathcal
L}=\B^a(\A \oplus M)$ of adjointable maps, where $M$ is the GNS bimodule of
$\mathcal L$, and the possibility of constructing a quantum random walk (in the
sense of \cite{AP,LP,L,KBS}) corresponding to $\mathcal L$.

The Invar Tensor Package,"Jose M. Martin-Garcia, Renato Portugal, Leon R. U. Manssur","  The Invar package is introduced, a fast manipulator of generic scalar

"Towards a Gauge Invariant Scattering Theory of Cylindrical Gravitational
  Waves",Andrea Macrina,"  In this account we investigate an asymptotically flat space-time geometry. In
particular, we focus on a pure gravity model with cylindrical symmetry where no
matter fields are included. The Einstein-Rosen metric is introduced and the
corresponding Einstein equations are solved. By use of the ADM formalism, we
derive the observables of the cylindrical gravitational waves. We conclude with
an analysis of the algebra of the observables of the Einstein-Rosen waves.

"On axisymmetric MHD equilibria with incompressible flows under side
  conditions","G. N. Throumoulopoulos, H. Tasso and G. Poulipoulis","  Axisymmetric equilibria with incompressible flows of arbitrary direction are
studied in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics under a variety of physically
relevant side conditions. To this end a set of pertinent non-linear ODEs are
transformed to quasilinear ones and the respective initial value problem is
solved numerically with appropriately determined initial values near the
magnetic axis. Several equilibria are then constructed surface by surface. The
non field aligned flow results in novel configurations with a single magnetic
axis, toroidal shell configurations in which the plasma is confined within a
couple of magnetic surfaces and double shell-like configurations. In addition,
the flow affects the elongation and triangularity of the magnetic surfaces.

"Vertex-algebraic structure of the principal subspaces of certain
  A_1^(1)-modules, I: level one case","Corina Calinescu, James Lepowsky, Antun Milas","  This is the first in a series of papers in which we study vertex-algebraic
structure of Feigin-Stoyanovsky's principal subspaces associated to standard
modules for both untwisted and twisted affine Lie algebras. A key idea is to
prove suitable presentations of principal subspaces, without using bases or
even ``small'' spanning sets of these spaces. In this paper we prove
presentations of the principal subspaces of the basic A_1^(1)-modules. These
convenient presentations were previously used in work of
Capparelli-Lepowsky-Milas for the purpose of obtaining the classical
Rogers-Ramanujan recursion for the graded dimensions of the principal
subspaces.
"
Galaxy Evolution and Environment,"Pieter van Dokkum, Ryan Quadri","  The properties of galaxies are strongly correlated with their environment,
with red galaxies dominating galaxy clusters and blue galaxies dominating the
general field. However, not all field galaxies are young: studies of the
colors, line strengths, and M/L ratios of massive early-type galaxies at
0<z<1.3 show that the most massive galaxies do not seem to care about their
surroundings, and have very similar ages irrespective of their environment.
There is good evidence that the growth of these galaxies does continue longer
in the field than in clusters, via (nearly) dissipationless mergers of already
old galaxies. These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxy
formation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation in
the most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies with
their environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory.
Intriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-density
relation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where both
surveys become highly incomplete. On the other hand, clustering studies at
z~2.5 have shown that red galaxies cluster more strongly than blue galaxies,
implying that the color-density relation was already in place at that redshift.
"
GLSM's for partial flag manifolds,"R. Donagi, E. Sharpe","  In this paper we outline some aspects of nonabelian gauged linear sigma
models. First, we review how partial flag manifolds (generalizing
Grassmannians) are described physically by nonabelian gauged linear sigma
models, paying attention to realizations of tangent bundles and other aspects
pertinent to (0,2) models. Second, we review constructions of Calabi-Yau
complete intersections within such flag manifolds, and properties of the gauged
linear sigma models. We discuss a number of examples of nonabelian GLSM's in
which the Kahler phases are not birational, and in which at least one phase is
realized in some fashion other than as a complete intersection, extending
previous work of Hori-Tong. We also review an example of an abelian GLSM
exhibiting the same phenomenon. We tentatively identify the mathematical
relationship between such non-birational phases, as examples of Kuznetsov's
homological projective duality. Finally, we discuss linear sigma model moduli
spaces in these gauged linear sigma models. We argue that the moduli spaces
being realized physically by these GLSM's are precisely Quot and hyperquot
schemes, as one would expect mathematically.

  University of Notre Dame)","  We present the first high-resolution, ground-based observations of HCN and
C2H2 toward the T Tauri binary star system GV Tau. We detected strong
absorption due to HCN nu_3 and weak C2H2 (nu_3 and nu_2 + (nu_4 + nu_5)^0_+)
absorption toward the primary (GV Tau S) but not the infrared companion. We
also report CO column densities and rotational temperatures, and present
abundances relative to CO of HCN/CO ~0.6% and C2H2/CO ~1.2% and an upper limit
for CH4/CO < 0.37% toward GV Tau S. Neither HCN nor C2H2 were detected toward
the infrared companion and results suggest that abundances may differ between
the two sources.
"
Towards understanding of birds magnetoreceptor mechanism,"Ilia A. Solov'yov, Walter Greiner","  In the present letter we suggest a new theoretical model for a quantitative
description of the magnetoreception mechanism in birds. The considered
mechanism involves two types of iron minerals (magnetite and maghemite) which
were found in subcellular compartments within sensory dendrites of the upper
beak of several bird species. The analysis of forces acting between the iron
particles shows that the orientation of the external geomagnetic field can
significantly change the probability of the mechanosensitive ion channels
opening and closing. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the
suggested magnetoreceptor system might be a sensitive biological magnetometer
providing an essential part of the magnetic map for navigation.

  Fadda (3), George Helou (1), Henrik Spoon (4)((1)Spitzer Science Center, (2)
  Pomona College, (3) Herschel Science Center, (4) Cornell)","  We present mid-IR spectral decomposition of a sample of 48 Spitzer-selected
ULIRGs spanning z~1-3 and likely L_IR~10^12-10^13Lsun. Our study aims at
quantifying the star-formation and AGN processes in these sources which recent
results suggest have evolved strongly between the observed epoch and today. To
do this, we study the mid-IR contribution of PAH emission, continuum, and
extinction. About 3/4 of our sample are continuum- (i.e. AGN) dominated
sources, but ~60% of these show PAH emission, suggesting the presence of
star-formation activity. These sources have redder mid-IR colors than typical
optically-selected quasars. About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,
but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high
5um hot dust continua. However, their steep 30um-to-14um slopes suggest that
star-formation might dominate the total infrared luminosity. Six of our z~2
sources have EW6.2>~0.3um and L_14um>~10^12Lsun (implying L_IR>~10^13Lsun). At
these luminosities, such high EW6.2 ULIRGs do not exist in the local Universe.
We find a median optical depth at 9.7um of <tau_9.7>=1.4. This is consistent
with local IRAS-selected ULIRGs, but differs from early results on
SCUBA-selected z~2 ULIRGs. Similar to local ULIRGs about 25% of our sample show
extreme obscuration (tau_9.7>~3) suggesting buried nuclei. In general, we find
that our sources are similar to local ULIRGs, but are an order of magnitude
more luminous. It is not clear whether our z~2 ULIRGs are simply scaled-up
versions of local ULIRGs, or subject to fundamentally different physical
processes.
"
Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a live dark halo,"O. Esquivel, B. Fuchs","  We investigate the Jeans instability of a galactic disk embedded in a
dynamically responsive dark halo. It is shown that the disk-halo system becomes
nominally Jeans unstable. On small scales the instability is suppressed, if the
Toomre stability index Q_T is higher than a certain threshold, but on large
scales the Jeans instability sets invariably in. However, using a simple
self-consistent disk-halo model it is demonstrated that this occurs on scales
which are much larger than the system so that this is indeed only a nominal
effect. From a practical point of view the Jeans instability of galactic disks
is not affected by a live dark halo.

"The multiplicity of planet host stars - New low-mass companions to
  planet host stars","M. Mugrauer, A. Seifahrt, R. Neuhaeuser","  We present new results from our ongoing multiplicity study of exoplanet host
stars, carried out with the infrared camera SofI at ESO-NTT. We have identified
new low mass companions to the planet host stars HD101930 and HD65216.
HD101930AB is a wide binary systems composed of the planet host star HD101930A
and its companion HD101930B which is a M0 to M1 dwarf with a mass of about
0.7Msun separated from the primary by ~73arcsec (2200AU projected separation).
HD65216 forms a hierarchical triple system, with a projected separation of
253AU (angular separation of about 7arcsec) between the planet host star
HD65216A and its close binary companion HD65216BC, whose two components are
separated by only ~0.17arcsec (6AU of projected separation). Two VLT-NACO
images separated by 3 years confirm that this system is co-moving to the planet
host star. The infrared photometry of HD65216B and C is consistent with a M7 to
M8 (0.089Msun), and a L2 to L3 dwarf (0.078Msun), respectively, both close to
the sub-stellar limit. An infrared spectrum with VLT-ISAAC of the pair
HD65216BC, even though not resolved spatially, confirms this late spectral
type. Furthermore, we present H- and K-band ISAAC infrared spectra of HD16141B,
the recently detected co-moving companion of the planet host star HD16141A. The
infrared spectroscopy as well as the apparent infrared photometry of HD16141B
are both fully consistent with a M2 to M3 dwarf located at the distance of the
planet host star.

"Assessment and Propagation of Input Uncertainty in Tree-based Option
  Pricing Models","Henryk Gzyl, German Molina, Enrique ter Horst","  This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment and
propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based
methods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting
that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option
pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close
the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,
and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative
frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter
uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods
with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options
market established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for
which there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to
account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

"Subdiffusion and weak ergodicity breaking in the presence of a reactive
  boundary","Michael A. Lomholt, Irwin M. Zaid, Ralf Metzler","  We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with
a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions,
that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells,
are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both
the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from
the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual
particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We
discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding
proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar

"Satellites of Simulated Galaxies: survival, merging, and their relation
  to the dark and stellar halos","L. V. Sales, J. F. Navarro, M. G. Abadi and M. Steinmetz","  We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a LCDM universe. We find
little spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite
population. The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of
the virial velocity of the halo: \sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to
the Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s and
V_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than the
rotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulated
satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellar
halo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from the
population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite
depends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biased
toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our
results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences
between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive
``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,
and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that
has survived self-bound until the present.

"Analysis of the Velocity Field of F and G Dwarfs in the Solar
  Neighborhood as a Function of Age","Vadim V. Bobylev, and Anisa T. Bajkova","  The space velocities from the catalog of Nordstrom et al. (2004) are used to
trace variations of a number of kinematic parameters of single F and G dwarfs
as a function of their age. The vertex deviation of disk stars increases from
7+- 1 to 15+-2 degrees as the mean age decreases from 4.3 to 1.5 Gyr. The
two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are
analyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be
followed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the
distributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are
concentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius
Cluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form
simultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in
all age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an
average age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable
fraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic
parameters exhibit a break near 4.5 Gyr, which can be explained as an effect of
the different contributions of stars of the thin and thick disks. The Stromberg
relation yields a solar LSR velocity of V_{\odot LSR} = (8.7, 6.2, 7.2)+- (0.5,
2.2, 0.8) km/s.

"Cosmic M\'enage \`a Trois: The Origin of Satellite Galaxies On Extreme
  Orbits","L. V. Sales, J. F. Navarro, M. G. Abadi and M. Steinmetz","  We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of $L_*$ galaxies in a LCDM
universe. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around,
they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii
are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. However, a number of outliers are
also present, we find that ~1/3 of satellites identified at $z=0$ are on
unorthodox orbits, with apocenters that exceed their turnaround radii. This
population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint
member of a satellite pair that has been ejected onto a highly-energetic orbit
during its first approach to the primary. Since the concurrent accretion of
multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of
galaxy formation, we speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31
(such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group
members, such as Leo I; and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus
and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care
must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to
place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.

"Photoproduction of pi0-mesons off protons from the Delta(1232) region to
  E(gamma) = 3 GeV","H. van Pee, O. Bartholomy, V. Crede (for the CB-ELSA Collaboration)","  Photoproduction of pi0 mesons was studied with the Crystal-Barrel detector at
ELSA for incident energies from 300 MeV to 3 GeV. Differential cross sections d
sigma /d Omega, d sigma/d t, and the total cross section are presented. For
E(gamma) < 3 GeV, the angular distributions agree well with the SAID
parametrization. At photon energies above 1.5 GeV, a strong forward peaking
indicates t-channel exchange to be the dominant process. The rapid variations
of the cross section with energy and angle indicate production of resonances.
An interpretation of the data within the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis is
briefly discussed.

Magnetic and axial-vector transitions of the baryon antidecuplet,"H.-Ch. Kim, Gh.-S. Yang, and K. Goeke","  We report the recent results of the magnetic transitions and axial-vector
transitions of the baryon antidecuplet within the framework of the chiral
quark-soliton model. The dynamical model parameters are fixed by experimental
data for the magnetic moments of the baryon octet, for the hyperon semileptonic
decay constants, and for the singlet axial-vector constant. The transition
magnetic moments $\mu_{\Lambda\Sigma}$ and $\mu_{N\Delta}$ are well reproduced
and other octet-decuplet and octet-antidecuplet transitions are predicted. In
particular, the present calculation of $\mu_{\Sigma\Sigma^*}$ is found to be
below the upper bound $0.82\mu_N$ that the SELEX collaboration measured very
recently. The results explains consistently the recent findings of a new $N^*$
resonance from the GRAAL and Tohoku LNS group. We also obtain the transition
axial-vector constants for the $\Theta^+\to KN$ from which the decay width of
the $\Theta^{+}$ pentaquark baryon is determined as a function of the
pion-nucleon sigma term $\Sigma_{\pi N}$. We investigate the dependence of the
decay width of the $\Theta^{+}$ on the $g_{A}^{(0)}$, with the $g_{A}^{(0)}$
varied within the range of the experimental uncertainty. We show that a small
decay width of the $\Theta^{+}\to KN$, i.e. $\Gamma_{\Theta KN} \leq 1$ MeV, is
compatible with the values of all known semileptonic decays with the generally
accepted value of $g_{A}^{(0)} \approx 0.3$ for the proton.

"Quenched limits for transient, zero speed one-dimensional random walk in
  random environment","Jonathon Peterson, Ofer Zeitouni","  We consider a nearest-neighbor, one dimensional random walk
$\{X_n\}_{n\geq0}$ in a random i.i.d. environment, in the regime where the walk
is transient but with zero speed, so that $X_n$ is of order $n^s$ for some
$s<1$. Under the quenched law (i.e., conditioned on the environment), we show
that no limit laws are possible: There exist sequences $\{n_k\}$ and $\{x_k\}$
depending on the environment only, such that $X_{n_k}-x_k=o(\log n_k)^2$ (a
localized regime). On the other hand, there exist sequences $\{t_m\}$ and
$\{s_m\}$ depending on the environment only, such that $\log s_m/\log t_m\to
s<1$ and $P_{\omega}(X_{t_m}/s_m\leq x)\to1/2$ for all $x>0$ and $\to0$ for
$x\leq0$ (a spread out regime).

Reciprocal transformations and flat metrics on Hurwitz spaces,"S. Abenda, T. Grava","  We consider hydrodynamic systems which possess a local Hamiltonian structure
of Dubrovin-Novikov type. To such a system there are also associated an
infinite number of nonlocal Hamiltonian structures. We give necessary and
sufficient conditions so that, after a nonlinear transformation of the
independent variables, the reciprocal system still possesses a local
Hamiltonian structure of Dubrovin-Novikov type. We show that, under our
hypotheses, bi-hamiltonicity is preserved by the reciprocal transformation.
Finally we apply such results to reciprocal systems of genus g Whitham-KdV
modulation equations.

HS1857+5144: A hot and young pre-cataclysmic variable,"A. Aungwerojwit, B. T. Gaensicke, P. Rodriguez-Gil, H.-J. Hagen, O.
  Giannakis, C. Papadimitriou, C. Allende Prieto and D. Engels","  We report the discovery of a new white dwarf/M dwarf binary, HS1857+5144,
identified in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). Time-resolved optical
spectroscopy and photometry were carried out to determine the properties of
this new cataclysmic variable progenitor pre-CV). The light curves of
HS1857+5144 display a sinusoidal variation with a period of Porb=383.52 min and
peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.7 mag and 1.1 mag in the B-band and R-band,
respectively. The large amplitude of the brightness variation results from a
reflection effect on the heated inner hemisphere of the companion star,
suggesting a very high temperature of the white dwarf. Our radial velocity
study confirms the photometric period as the orbital period of the system. A
model atmosphere fit to the spectrum of the white dwarf obtained at minimum
light provides limits to its mass and temperature of Mwd=~0.6-1.0 Msun and
Twd=~70000-100000 K, respectively. The detection of HeII 4686 absorption
classifies the primary star of HS1857+5144 as a DAO white dwarf. Combining the
results from our spectroscopy and photometry, we estimate the mass of the
companion star and the binary inclination to be Msec=~0.15-0.30 Msun and
i=~45-55 deg, respectively. We classify HS1857+5144 as one of the youngest
pre-CV known to date. The cooling age of the white dwarf suggests that the
present system has just emerged from a common envelope phase ~10^5 yr ago.
HS1857+5144 will start mass transfer within or below the 2-3h period gap.

$^{10}$Li spectrum from $^{11}$Li fragmentation,"G. Blanchon (INFN and Physics Department, Pisa), A. Bonaccorso (INFN

from a bound state to a continuum resonant state in the system n+core is
applied to the study of the population of the low energy continuum of the

the model results to new data from the GSI laboratory suggests that the

the two mechanisms give almost identical results. There is also, for the first

Asymptotics of the Euler number of bipartite graphs,Richard Ehrenborg and Yossi Farjoun,"  We define the Euler number of a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices to be the
number of labelings of the vertices with $1,2,...,n$ such that the vertices
alternate in being local maxima and local minima. We reformulate the problem of
computing the Euler number of certain subgraphs of the Cartesian product of a
graph $G$ with the path $P_m$ in terms of self adjoint operators. The
asymptotic expansion of the Euler number is given in terms of the eigenvalues
of the associated operator. For two classes of graphs, the comb graphs and the
Cartesian product $P_2 \Box P_m$, we numerically solve the eigenvalue problem.
"
Unicast and Multicast Qos Routing with Soft Constraint Logic Programming,"Stefano Bistarelli, Ugo Montanari, Francesca Rossi, Francesco Santini","  We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast
routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To
attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph
(unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector
corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related
network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS
metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step
consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic
Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best
paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on
them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.
Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At
last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks
and we suggest how the performance can be improved.

Zero point energy on extra dimension: Noncommutative Torus,"S.Fabi, B.Harms, G.Karatheodoris","  In this paper we calculate the zero point energy density experienced by
observers on M^4 due to a massless scalar field defined throughout M^4 x T^2_F,
where T^2_F are fuzzy extra dimensions. Using the Green's function approach we
calculate the energy density for the commutative torus and the fuzzy torus. We
calculate then the energy density for the fuzzy torus using the Hamiltonian

approaches.

Three-body collisions in Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck theory,"A.B. Larionov, O. Buss, K. Gallmeister and U. Mosel","  Aiming at a microscopic description of heavy ion collisions in the beam
energy region of about 10 A GeV, we extend the Giessen
Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) transport model by including a relativistic
mean field, in-medium baryon-baryon cross sections and three-body collisions.
The model is then compared with experimental data for central Au+Au collisions
at 2-10 A GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at 30 and 40 A GeV on the proton
rapidity spectra, the midrapidity yields of $\pi^+$, $K^\pm$ and
$(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)$, and the transverse mass spectra of $\pi^\pm$ and $K^\pm$.
The three-body collisions increase the inverse slope parameters of the hadron
$m_\perp$-spectra to a good agreement with the data.

Learning more from the Lorentz transformations,Stefan Popescu and Bernhard Rothenstein,"  Admitting the validity of Lorentz transformations for the space as time
coordinates of the same event we derive their differential form in order to
underline the correct prerequisites for the application of time and length
contraction or dilation effects. Furthermore we quantify the simultaneity error
occurring in the relativity theory. Having done this, we analyse the root cause
of these effects and identify it with a finite phase velocity associated with
the moving frame. We define this phase velocity by analogy to the de Broglie
wave associated with a moving particle. Based on this construct we demonstrate
that the phase of the de Broglie waves further extended for stationary
particles is a relativistic invariant being the same for all corresponding
observers. Also the phase of the electromagnetic waves transporting energy at
light speed is a relativistic invariant. Therefore the universe and its matter
/ energy may be seen as a superposition of waves propagating such that their
phase is the same for all corresponding observers. The wave phase may replace
the time as an invariant and universal reference.

"On the Mapping of Time-Dependent Densities onto Potentials in Quantum
  Mechanics",Roi Baer,"  The mapping of time-dependent densities on potentials in quantum mechanics is
critically examined. The issue is of significance ever since Runge and Gross
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997 (1984)) established the uniqueness of the mapping,
forming a theoretical basis for time-dependent density functional theory. We
argue that besides existence (so called v-representability) and uniqueness
there is an important question of stability and chaos. Studying a 2-level
system we find innocent, almost constant densities that cannot be constructed
from any potential (non-existence). We further show via a Lyapunov analysis
that the mapping of densities on potentials has chaotic regions in this case.
In real space the situation is more subtle. V-representability is formally
assured but the mapping is often chaotic making the actual construction of the
potential almost impossible. The chaotic nature of the mapping, studied for the
first time here, has serious consequences regarding the possibility of using
TDDFT in real-time settings.

New Jarlskog determinant from Physics above the GUT Scal,"Bipin Singh Koranga and S. Uma Sankar (Indian Institute of Technology
  Bombay)","  We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum
gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)
invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which
gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry
breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute
the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of
neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog
determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale
effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the
Planck scale effects.

Models of Opinion Formation: Influence of Opinion Leaders,Nino Boccara,"  This paper studies the evolution of the distribution of opinions in a
population of individuals in which there exist two distinct subgroups of
highly-committed, well-connected opinion leaders endowed with a strong
convincing power. Each individual, located at a vertex of a directed graph, is
characterized by her name, the list of people she is interacting with, her
level of awareness, and her opinion. Various temporal evolutions according to
different local rules are compared in order to find under which conditions the
formation of strongly polarized subgroups, each adopting the opinion of one of
the two groups of opinion leaders, is favored.
"
Chiral Mechanisms Leading to Orbital Quantum Structures in the Nucleon,Dennis Sivers,"  Color confinement and chiral symmetry specify some important territory for
the study of hadronic physics. Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet
composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the
landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark
flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental
scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of
the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics
and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an
evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the
normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the
Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures
in the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a
confined system defined by the quantum numbers of the nucleon in the
constituent quark model. The orbital structure functions for antiquarks can
also be specified within the basic framework of this approach while the
normalization of the gluon orbital structure function requires some additional
assumptions.
"
Quantum control and entanglement using periodic driving fields,C.E. Creffield,"  We propose a scheme for producing directed motion in a lattice system by
applying a periodic driving potential. By controlling the dynamics by means of
the effect known as coherent destruction of tunneling, we demonstrate a novel
ratchet-like effect that enables particles to be coherently manipulated and
steered without requiring local control. Entanglement between particles can
also be controllably generated, which points to the attractive possibility of
using these technique for quantum information processing.
"
Intrinsic ripples in graphene,"A. Fasolino, J. H. Los and M. I. Katsnelson","  The stability of two-dimensional (2D) layers and membranes is subject of a
long standing theoretical debate. According to the so called Mermin-Wagner
theorem, long wavelength fluctuations destroy the long-range order for 2D
crystals. Similarly, 2D membranes embedded in a 3D space have a tendency to be
crumpled. These dangerous fluctuations can, however, be suppressed by
anharmonic coupling between bending and stretching modes making that a
two-dimensional membrane can exist but should present strong height
fluctuations. The discovery of graphene, the first truly 2D crystal and the
recent experimental observation of ripples in freely hanging graphene makes
these issues especially important. Beside the academic interest, understanding
the mechanisms of stability of graphene is crucial for understanding electronic
transport in this material that is attracting so much interest for its unusual
Dirac spectrum and electronic properties. Here we address the nature of these
height fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlo
simulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential for
carbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuations
with a size distribution peaked around 70 \AA which is compatible with
experimental findings (50-100 \AA) but not with the current understanding of
stability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the
multiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.

"Counting and manipulating single electrons using a carbon nanotube
  transistor","An. Gruneis, M.J. Esplandiu, D. Garcia-Sanchez, and A. Bachtold","  We report on the electric measurements of an individual Au nanoparticle with
an ultra-high contact resistance of about $10^{19} \Omega$. The high-impedance
measurements have been carried out by counting the electrons that are
transferred onto the particle. In order to do this, a carbon nanotube is used
as the electrode for the supply of electrons but also as the detector of the
charge transfer. Measurements using single-electron detection allow us to
determine the separation between the electron states in the Au nanoparticle,
which is about 4 meV, consistent with the charging energy of the particle.
Single-electron detection with nanotubes offers great promise for the study of
electron transfer in highly resistive molecular systems.

"Representation Theorems for Quadratic ${\cal F}$-Consistent Nonlinear
  Expectations","Ying Hu (IRMAR), Jin Ma (Department of Mathematics), Shige Peng
  (Institute of Mathematics), Song Yao (Department of Mathematics)","  In this paper we extend the notion of ``filtration-consistent nonlinear
expectation"" (or ""${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear expectation"") to the case
when it is allowed to be dominated by a $g$-expectation that may have a
quadratic growth. We show that for such a nonlinear expectation many
fundamental properties of a martingale can still make sense, including the
Doob-Meyer type decomposition theorem and the optional sampling theorem. More
importantly, we show that any quadratic ${\cal F}$-consistent nonlinear
expectation with a certain domination property must be a quadratic
$g$-expectation. The main contribution of this paper is the finding of the
domination condition to replace the one used in all the previous works, which
is no longer valid in the quadratic case. We also show that the representation
generator must be deterministic, continuous, and actually must be of the simple
form.

"Film Thickness Changes in EHD Sliding Contacts Lubricated by a Fatty
  Alcohol","Kazuyuki Yagi (LaMCoS), Philippe Vergne (LaMCoS)","  This paper describes the appearance of abnormal film thickness features
formed in elastohydrodynamic contacts lubricated by a fatty alcohol.
Experiments were conducted by varying the slide to roll ratio between a steel
ball and a glass disk in a ball-on-disk type device. Lauric alcohol was used as
lubricant and film thickness was measured in the contact area by optical
interferometry. Experimental results showed that the film thickness
distributions under pure rolling conditions remained classical whereas the film
shape changed when the slide to roll ratio was increased. The thickness in the
central contact area increased and in the same time inlet and exit film
thicknesses were modified. In addition, the film shapes observed when the ball
surface was moving faster than the disk one and those obtained in the opposite
case were different, i.e. when opposite signs but equal absolute values of the
slide to roll ratio were applied.

"A unified shear-thinning treatment of both film thickness and traction
  in EHD","Scott Bair, Philippe Vergne (LaMCoS), Michel Querry (LaMCoS)","  A conclusive demonstration has been provided that the nature of the
shear-thinning, that affects both film thickness and traction in EHL contacts,
follows the ordinary power-law rule that has been described by many empirical
models of which Carreau is but one example. This was accomplished by accurate
measurements in viscometers of the shear response of a PAO that possesses a
very low critical stress for shear-thinning and accurate measurements
in-contact of film thickness and traction under conditions which accentuate the
shear-thinning effect. The in-contact central film thickness and traction were
entirely predictable from the rheological properties obtained from viscometers
using simple calculations. These data should be invaluable to researchers
endeavoring to accurately simulate Hertz zone behavior since the shear-thinning
rheology is extensively characterized and accurate in-contact data are
available to test. In addition, a new model has been introduced that may be
useful for the rheological characterization of mixtures.

Super Low Traction under EHD and Mixed Lubrication Regimes,Philippe Vergne (LaMCoS),"  After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on
MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further
confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word
investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large
mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has
lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most
promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or
diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical
applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest
friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.
fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they
vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is
consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to
those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super
low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in
the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak
perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles
in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above
conditions.

Phenomenology with Massive Neutrinos,M.C. Gonzalez-Garcia and Michele Maltoni,"  The current status and some perspectives of the phenomenology of massive
neutrinos is reviewed. We start with the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations
in vacuum and in matter. We summarize the results of neutrino experiments using
solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. We update the
leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation
of this data. We describe the method and present results on our understanding
of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the
corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of
new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum
and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim
and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance
in these fronts is also briefly summarized. Last, the implications of the LSND
observations are discussed, and the status of extended models which could
accommodate all flavor-mixing signals is presented in the light of the recent
results from MiniBooNE.

A calculation of the shear viscosity in SU(3) gluodynamics,Harvey B. Meyer,"  We perform a lattice Monte-Carlo calculation of the two-point functions of
the energy-momentum tensor at finite temperature in the SU(3) gauge theory.
Unprecedented precision is obtained thanks to a multi-level algorithm. The
lattice operators are renormalized non-perturbatively and the classical
discretization errors affecting the correlators are corrected for. A robust
upper bound for the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is derived, eta/s
< 1.0, and our best estimate is eta/s = 0.134(33) at T=1.65Tc under the
assumption of smoothness of the spectral function in the low-frequency region.
"
A Way to Dynamically Overcome the Cosmological Constant Problem,Denis Comelli,"  The Cosmological Constant problem can be solved once we require that the full
standard Einstein Hilbert lagrangian, gravity plus matter, is multiplied by a
total derivative. We analyze such a picture writing the total derivative as the
covariant gradient of a new vector field (b_mu). The dynamics of this b_mu
field can play a key role in the explanation of the present cosmological
acceleration of the Universe.

"Regularity properties in the classification program for separable

"Equation of state of atomic systems beyond s-wave determined by the
  lowest order constrained variational method: Large scattering length limit","Ryan M. Kalas, D. Blume","  Dilute Fermi systems with large s-wave scattering length a_s exhibit
universal properties if the interparticle spacing r_o greatly exceeds the range
of the underlying two-body interaction potential. In this regime, r_o is the
only relevant length scale and observables such as the energy per particle
depend only on r_o (or, equivalently, the energy E_{FG} of the free Fermi gas).
This paper investigates Bose and Fermi systems with non-vanishing angular
momentum l using the lowest order constrained variational method. We focus on
the regime where the generalized scattering length becomes large and determine
the relevant length scales. For Bose gases with large generalized scattering
lengths, we obtain simple expressions for the energy per particle in terms of a
l-dependent length scale \xi_l, which depends on the range of the underlying
two-body potential and the average interparticle spacing. We discuss possible
implications for dilute two-component Fermi systems with finite l. Furthermore,
we determine the equation of state of liquid and gaseous bosonic helium.

"On Charge Conservation and The Equivalence Principle in the
  Noncommutative Spacetime",Youngone Lee,"  We investigate one of the consequences of the twisted Poincare symmetry. We
derive the charge conservation law and show that the equivalence principle is
satisfied in the canonical noncommutative spacetime. We applied the twisted
Poincare symmetry to the Weinberg's analysis. To this end, we generalize our
earlier construction of the twisted S matrix \cite{Bu}, which apply the
noncommutativity to the fourier modes, to the massless fields of integer spins.
The transformation formula for the twisted S matrix for the massless fields of
integer spin has been obtained. For massless fields of spin 1, we obtain the
conservation of charge, and the universality of coupling constant for massless
fields of spin 2, which can be interpreted as the equality of gravitational
mass and inertial mass, i.e., the equivalence principle.
"
Critical Scaling of Shear Viscosity at the Jamming Transition,Peter Olsson and S. Teitel,"  We carry out numerical simulations to study transport behavior about the
jamming transition of a model granular material in two dimensions at zero
temperature. Shear viscosity \eta is computed as a function of particle volume
density \rho and applied shear stress \sigma, for diffusively moving particles
with a soft core interaction. We find an excellent scaling collapse of our data
as a function of the scaling variable \sigma/|\rho_c-\rho|^\Delta, where \rho_c
is the critical density at \sigma=0 (""point J""), and \Delta is the crossover
scaling critical exponent. Our results show that jamming is a true critical
phenomenon, extending to driven steady states along the non-equilibrium \sigma
axis of the \rho-\sigma phase diagram.

Polar actions on compact Euclidean hypersurfaces,Ion Moutinho and Ruy Tojeiro,"  Given an isometric immersion $f\colon M^n\to \R^{n+1}$ of a compact
Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ into Euclidean space of dimension
$n+1$, we prove that the identity component $Iso^0(M^n)$ of the isometry group
$Iso(M^n)$ of $M^n$ admits an orthogonal representation $\Phi\colon
Iso^0(M^n)\to SO(n+1)$ such that $f\circ g=\Phi(g)\circ f$ for every $g\in
Iso^0(M^n)$. If $G$ is a closed connected subgroup of $Iso(M^n)$ acting locally
polarly on $M^n$, we prove that $\Phi(G)$ acts polarly on $\R^{n+1}$, and we
obtain that $f(M^n)$ is given as $\Phi(G)(L)$, where $L$ is a hypersurface of a
section which is invariant under the Weyl group of the $\Phi(G)$-action. We
also find several sufficient conditions for such an $f$ to be a rotation
hypersurface. Finally, we show that compact Euclidean rotation hypersurfaces of
dimension $n\geq 3$ are characterized by their underlying warped product
structure.

"Tests of Bayesian Model Selection Techniques for Gravitational Wave
  Astronomy",Neil J. Cornish and Tyson B. Littenberg,"  The analysis of gravitational wave data involves many model selection
problems. The most important example is the detection problem of selecting
between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or instrument
noise and a gravitational wave signal. The analysis of data from ground based
gravitational wave detectors is mostly conducted using classical statistics,
and methods such as the Neyman-Pearson criteria are used for model selection.
Future space based detectors, such as the \emph{Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna} (LISA), are expected to produced rich data streams containing the
signals from many millions of sources. Determining the number of sources that
are resolvable, and the most appropriate description of each source poses a
challenging model selection problem that may best be addressed in a Bayesian
framework. An important class of LISA sources are the millions of low-mass
binary systems within our own galaxy, tens of thousands of which will be
detectable. Not only are the number of sources unknown, but so are the number
of parameters required to model the waveforms. For example, a significant
subset of the resolvable galactic binaries will exhibit orbital frequency
evolution, while a smaller number will have measurable eccentricity. In the
Bayesian approach to model selection one needs to compute the Bayes factor
between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes
factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable
frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes
Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model
evidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.

"All tight multipartite Bell correlation inequalities for an arbitrary
  number of dichotomic observables per observer",Piotr Badziag and Marek Zukowski,"  Derivation of the full set of Bell inequalities involving correlation
functions, for two parties, with binary observables, and N possible local
settings is not as easy as it seemed. The proof of v1 is wrong. Additionaly one
can find a counterexample, which will be presented soon. Thus our thesis is
dead. Still the series of Bell inequalities discussed in the manuscript (v1)
form a necessary condition for local realism, and are tight. They are tight and
complete (sufficient) only for N=3 settings per observer (as shown in
quant-ph/0611086, fortunately using an entirely different approach).

"A Cascade Model for Particle Concentration and Enstrophy in Fully
  Developed Turbulence with Mass Loading Feedback",Robert C. Hogan and Jeffrey N. Cuzzi,"  A cascade model is described based on multiplier distributions determined
from 3D direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent particle laden flows,
which include two-way coupling between the phases at global mass loadings equal
to unity. The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectral
methods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particle
concentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range
34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) on
spatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,
which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loading
within the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional form
of this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the range
considered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascade
model to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particle
concentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions of
concentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to be
in excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.
Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numbers
well beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearly
indicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities of
high particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting from
unloaded runs. Particle mass density appears to reach a limit at around 100
times the gas density. This approach has promise for significant computational
savings in certain applications.

Unifying Evolutionary and Network Dynamics,Samarth Swarup and Les Gasser,"  Many important real-world networks manifest ""small-world"" properties such as
scale-free degree distributions, small diameters, and clustering. The most
common model of growth for these networks is ""preferential attachment"", where
nodes acquire new links with probability proportional to the number of links
they already have. We show that preferential attachment is a special case of
the process of molecular evolution. We present a new single-parameter model of
network growth that unifies varieties of preferential attachment with the
quasispecies equation (which models molecular evolution), and also with the
Erdos-Renyi random graph model. We suggest some properties of evolutionary
models that might be applied to the study of networks. We also derive the form
of the degree distribution resulting from our algorithm, and we show through
simulations that the process also models aspects of network growth. The
unification allows mathematical machinery developed for evolutionary dynamics
to be applied in the study of network dynamics, and vice versa.

arcsec/yr. 21 VLM binaries were detected, 13 of them new discoveries. The new
binary systems range in separation between 0.18 arcsec and 1.3 arcsec. The
distance-corrected binary fraction is 13.5% (+6.5%/-4%), in agreement with
previous results. 9 of the new binary systems have orbital radii > 10 AU,
including a new wide VLM binary with 27 AU projected orbital separation. One of
the new systems forms two components of a 2300 AU separation triple system. We
find that the orbital radius distribution of the binaries with V-K < 6.5 in
this survey appears to be different from that of redder (lower-mass) objects,
suggesting a possible rapid change in the orbital radius distribution at around
the M5 spectral type. The target sample was also selected to investigate X-ray
activity among VLM binaries. There is no detectable correlation between excess
X-Ray emission and the frequency and binary properties of the VLM systems.

The Discovery of a Companion to the Lowest Mass White Dwarf,"Mukremin Kilic, Warren R. Brown, Carlos Allende Prieto, M. H.
  Pinsonneault, and S. J. Kenyon","  We report the detection of a radial velocity companion to SDSS
J091709.55+463821.8, the lowest mass white dwarf currently known with
M~0.17Msun. The radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a
semi-amplitude of 148.8 km/s and a period of 7.5936 hours, which implies a
companion mass of M > 0.28Msun. The lack of evidence of a companion in the
optical photometry forces any main-sequence companion to be smaller than
0.1Msun, hence a low mass main sequence star companion is ruled out for this
system. The companion is most likely another white dwarf, and we present
tentative evidence for an evolutionary scenario which could have produced it.
However, a neutron star companion cannot be ruled out and follow-up radio
observations are required to search for a pulsar companion.

A Measure of de Sitter Entropy and Eternal Inflation,"Nima Arkani-Hamed, Sergei Dubovsky, Alberto Nicolis, Enrico
  Trincherini, Giovanni Villadoro","  We show that in any model of non-eternal inflation satisfying the null energy
condition, the area of the de Sitter horizon increases by at least one Planck
unit in each inflationary e-folding. This observation gives an operational
meaning to the finiteness of the entropy S_dS of an inflationary de Sitter
space eventually exiting into an asymptotically flat region: the asymptotic
observer is never able to measure more than e^(S_dS) independent inflationary
modes. This suggests a limitation on the amount of de Sitter space outside the
horizon that can be consistently described at the semiclassical level, fitting
well with other examples of the breakdown of locality in quantum gravity, such
as in black hole evaporation. The bound does not hold in models of inflation
that violate the null energy condition, such as ghost inflation. This
strengthens the case for the thermodynamical interpretation of the bound as
conventional black hole thermodynamics also fails in these models, strongly
suggesting that these theories are incompatible with basic gravitational
principles.

Kondo-lattice screening in a d-wave superconductor,"Daniel E. Sheehy (Louisiana State University) and Joerg Schmalian
  (Iowa State University)","  We show that local moment screening in a Kondo lattice with d-wave
superconducting conduction electrons is qualitatively different from the
corresponding single Kondo impurity case. Despite the conduction-electron
pseudogap, Kondo-lattice screening is stable if the gap amplitude obeys $\Delta
<\sqrt{\tk D}$, in contrast to the single impurity condition $\Delta <\tk$
(where $\tk$ is the Kondo temperature for $\Delta = 0$ and D is the bandwidth).
Our theory explains the heavy electron behavior in the d-wave superconductor
Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4}.

"Coincident, 100 kpc-scale damped Lyman alpha absorption towards a binary
  QSO: how large are galaxies at z ~ 3?","Sara L. Ellison, Joseph F. Hennawi, Crystal L. Martin, Jesper
  Sommer-Larsen","  We report coincident damped Lyman alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA absorption at z =
2.66 and z = 2.94 towards the z ~ 3 13.8 arcsecond separation binary quasar
SDSS 1116+4118 AB. At the redshifts of the absorbers, this angular separation
corresponds to a proper transverse separation of ~ 110 kpc. A third absorber, a
sub-DLA at z = 2.47, is detected towards SDSS 1116+4118 B, but no corresponding
high column density absorber is present towards SDSS 1116+4118 A. We use high
resolution galaxy simulations and a clustering analysis to interpret the
coincident absorption and its implications for galaxy structure at z ~ 3. We
conclude that the common absorption in the two lines of sight is unlikely to
arise from a single galaxy, or a galaxy plus satellite system, and is more
feasibly explained by a group of two or more galaxies with separations ~ 100
kpc. The impact of these findings on single line of sight observations is also
discussed; we show that abundances of DLAs may be affected by up to a few
tenths of a dex by line of sight DLA blending. From a Keck ESI spectrum of the
two quasars, we measure metal column densities for all five absorbers and
determine abundances for the three absorbers with log N(HI) > 20. For the two
highest N(HI) absorbers, we determine high levels of metal enrichment,
corresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 solar. These metallicities are amongst the highest
measured for DLAs at any redshift and are consistent with values measured in
Lyman break galaxies at 2 < z < 3. For the DLA at z = 2.94 we also infer an
approximately solar ratio of alpha-to-Fe peak elements from [S/Zn] = +0.05, and
measure an upper limit for the molecular fraction in this particular line of
sight of log f(H_2)< -5.5.

Redefining the Missing Satellites Problem,"Louis E. Strigari, James S. Bullock, Manoj Kaplinghat, Juerg Diemand,
  Michael Kuhlen, Piero Madau","  Numerical simulations of Milky-Way size Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos predict
a steeply rising mass function of small dark matter subhalos and a substructure
count that greatly outnumbers the observed satellites of the Milky Way. Several
proposed explanations exist, but detailed comparison between theory and
observation in terms of the maximum circular velocity (Vmax) of the subhalos is
hampered by the fact that Vmax for satellite halos is poorly constrained. We
present comprehensive mass models for the well-known Milky Way dwarf
satellites, and derive likelihood functions to show that their masses within
0.6 kpc (M_0.6) are strongly constrained by the present data. We show that the
M_0.6 mass function of luminous satellite halos is flat between ~ 10^7 and 10^8
M_\odot. We use the ``Via Lactea'' N-body simulation to show that the M_0.6
mass function of CDM subhalos is steeply rising over this range. We rule out
the hypothesis that the 11 well-known satellites of the Milky Way are hosted by
the 11 most massive subhalos. We show that models where the brightest
satellites correspond to the earliest forming subhalos or the most massive
accreted objects both reproduce the observed mass function. A similar analysis
with the newly-discovered dwarf satellites will further test these scenarios
and provide powerful constraints on the CDM small-scale power spectrum and warm
dark matter models.

"Low-density graph codes that are optimal for source/channel coding and
  binning","Martin J. Wainwright, Emin Martinian","  We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class
of sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix
(LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of
theorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees
remaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously
optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are
performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we
prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the
rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel
coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the
capacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our
compound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve
the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as
the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).
Although the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the
proposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them
well-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.

Comments on Charges and Near-Horizon Data of Black Rings,"Kentaro Hanaki, Keisuke Ohashi and Yuji Tachikawa","  We study how the charges of the black rings measured at the asymptotic
infinity are encoded in the near-horizon metric and gauge potentials,
independent of the detailed structure of the connecting region. Our analysis
clarifies how different sets of four-dimensional charges can be assigned to a
single five-dimensional object under the Kaluza-Klein reduction. Possible
choices are related by the Witten effect on dyons and by the large gauge
transformation in four and five dimensions, respectively.

Odd Triplet Pairing in clean Superconductor/Ferromagnet heterostructures,"Klaus Halterman, Paul H. Barsic, and Oriol T. Valls","  We study triplet pairing correlations in clean Ferromagnet (F)/Superconductor
(S) nanojunctions, via fully self consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. We consider FSF trilayers, with S being an s-wave
superconductor, and an arbitrary angle $\alpha$ between the magnetizations of
the two F layers. We find that contrary to some previous expectations, triplet
correlations, odd in time, are induced in both the S and F layers in the clean
limit. We investigate their behavior as a function of time, position, and
$\alpha$. The triplet amplitudes are largest at times on the order of the
inverse ``Debye'' frequency, and at that time scale they are long ranged in
both S and F. The zero temperature condensation energy is found to be lowest
when the magnetizations are antiparallel.
"
The S-parameter in Holographic Technicolor Models,"Kaustubh Agashe, Csaba Csaki, Christophe Grojean, Matthew Reece","  We study the S parameter, considering especially its sign, in models of
electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in extra dimensions, with fermions
localized near the UV brane. Such models are conjectured to be dual to 4D
strong dynamics triggering EWSB. The motivation for such a study is that a
negative value of S can significantly ameliorate the constraints from
electroweak precision data on these models, allowing lower mass scales (TeV or
below) for the new particles and leading to easier discovery at the LHC. We
first extend an earlier proof of S>0 for EWSB by boundary conditions in
arbitrary metric to the case of general kinetic functions for the gauge fields
or arbitrary kinetic mixing. We then consider EWSB in the bulk by a Higgs VEV
showing that S is positive for arbitrary metric and Higgs profile, assuming
that the effects from higher-dimensional operators in the 5D theory are
sub-leading and can therefore be neglected. For the specific case of AdS_5 with
a power law Higgs profile, we also show that S ~ + O(1), including effects of
possible kinetic mixing from higher-dimensional operator (of NDA size) in the
$5D$ theory. Therefore, our work strongly suggests that S is positive in
calculable models in extra dimensions.

Stochastic Heat Equation Driven by Fractional Noise and Local Time,"Yaozhong Hu, David Nualart","  The aim of this paper is to study the $d$-dimensional stochastic heat
equation with a multiplicative Gaussian noise which is white in space and it
has the covariance of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $% H\in
(0,1)$ in time. Two types of equations are considered. First we consider the
equation in the It\^{o}-Skorohod sense, and later in the Stratonovich sense. An
explicit chaos development for the solution is obtained. On the other hand, the
moments of the solution are expressed in terms of the exponential moments of
some weighted intersection local time of the Brownian motion.

"Extended envelopes around Galactic Cepheids III. Y Oph and alpha Per
  from near-infrared interferometry with CHARA/FLUOR","A. M\'erand, J. Audenberg, P. Kervella, V. Coud\'e du Foresto, T. ten
  Brummelaar, H. McAlister, et al","  Unbiased angular diameter measurements are required for accurate distances to
Cepheids using the interferometric Baade Wesselink method (IBWM). The precision
of this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the
1.5% level. At this level, the center-to-limb darkening (CLD) and the presence
of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) seem to be the two main sources of bias. The
observations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometric
visibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematic
presence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with the
IBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters. We observed a Cepheid (Y Oph) for
which the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant
(alpha Per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. We interpreted
these data using a simple CSE model we previously developed. We found that our
observations of alpha Per do not provide evidence for a CSE. The measured CLD
is explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. Our observations of Y Oph,
when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surrounded
by a CSE with similar characteristics to CSE found previously around other
Cepheids. We have determined the distance to Y Oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.
Additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most Cepheids are
surrounded by faint CSE, detected by near infrared interferometry: after
observing four Cepheids, all show evidence for a CSE. Our CSE non-detection
around a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha Per, provides
confidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-loss
mechanism for the Cepheids.

"Squark and Gaugino Hadroproduction and Decays in Non-Minimal Flavour
  Violating Supersymmetry","G. Bozzi (ITP Karlsruhe), B. Fuks, B. Herrmann, M. Klasen (LPSC
  Grenoble)","  We present an extensive analysis of squark and gaugino hadroproduction and
decays in non-minimal flavour violating supersymmetry. We employ the so-called
super-CKM basis to define the possible misalignment of quark and squark
rotations, and we use generalized (possibly complex) charges to define the
mutual couplings of (s)quarks and gauge bosons/gauginos. The cross sections for
all squark-(anti-)squark/gaugino pair and squark-gaugino associated production
processes as well as their decay widths are then given in compact analytic
form. For four different constrained supersymmetry breaking models with
non-minimal flavour violation in the second/third generation squark sector
only, we establish the parameter space regions allowed/favoured by low-energy,
electroweak precision, and cosmological constraints and display the chirality
and flavour decomposition of all up- and down-type squark mass eigenstates.
Finally, we compute numerically the dependence of a representative sample of
production cross sections at the LHC on the off-diagonal mass matrix elements
in the experimentally allowed/favoured ranges.

Transaction-Oriented Simulation In Ad Hoc Grids,Gerald Krafft,"  This paper analyses the possibilities of performing parallel
transaction-oriented simulations with a special focus on the space-parallel
approach and discrete event simulation synchronisation algorithms that are
suitable for transaction-oriented simulation and the target environment of Ad
Hoc Grids. To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel
transaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is
implemented on the basis of the promising Shock Resistant Time Warp
synchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The
validation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves
but it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion
of this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm to avoid such problems.

"Gauge invariance in gravity-like descriptions of massive gauge field
  theories",Dennis D. Dietrich,"  We discuss gravity-like formulations of massive Abelian and non-Abelian gauge
field theories in four space-time dimensions with particular emphasis on the
issue of gauge invariance. Alternative descriptions in terms of antisymmetric
tensor fields and geometric variables, respectively, are analysed. In both
approaches St\""uckelberg degrees of freedom factor out. We also demonstrate, in
the Abelian case, that the massless limit for the gauge propagator, which does
not exist in the vector potential formulation, is well-defined for the
antisymmetric tensor fields.

On-line Chain Partitions of Up-growing Semi-orders,"Stefan Felsner, Kamil Kloch, Grzegorz Matecki, and Piotr Micek","  On-line chain partition is a two-player game between Spoiler and Algorithm.
Spoiler presents a partially ordered set, point by point. Algorithm assigns
incoming points (immediately and irrevocably) to the chains which constitute a
chain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width $w$ is
a minimum number $\fVal(w)$ such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most
$\fVal(w)$ chains on orders of width at most $w$. We analyze the chain
partition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes
into play and the value of the game is $\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\; w
\rfloor$.

Multiplicity Fluctuations in Au+Au Collisions at RHIC,"V.P. Konchakovski, M.I. Gorenstein and E.L. Bratkovskaya","  The preliminary data of the PHENIX collaboration for the scaled variances of
charged hadron multiplicity fluctuations in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV are
analyzed within the model of independent sources. We use the HSD transport
model to calculate the participant number fluctuations and the number of
charged hadrons per nucleon participant in different centrality bins. This
combined picture leads to a good agreement with the PHENIX data and suggests
that the measured multiplicity fluctuations result dominantly from participant
number fluctuations. The role of centrality selection and acceptance is
discussed separately.

  The new near and mid-IR photometry extend effectively two magnitudes deeper
than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new
set of candidate very low mass and sub-stellar mass members of the Pleiades in
the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members
fainter than Ks =14 (corresponding to 0.1 Mo). These candidate members should
eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down
to of order 0.04 solar masses.
  We also use new IRAC data, in particular the images obtained at 8 um, in
order to comment briefly on interstellar dust in and near the Pleiades. We
confirm, as expected, that -- with one exception -- a sample of low mass stars
recently identified as having 24 um excesses due to debris disks do not have
significant excesses at IRAC wavelengths. However, evidence is also presented
that several of the Pleiades high mass stars are found to be impacting with
local condensations of the molecular cloud that is passing through the Pleiades
at the current epoch.

Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function,"Inanc Inan, Feyza Keceli, Ender Ayanoglu","  The IEEE 802.11e standard revises the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of
the former IEEE 802.11 standard for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision in the

AC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS)
values, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and
prioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which
incorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic
load. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer
buffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared
to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads,
EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.

"Charge Ordering in Half-Doped Manganites: Weak Charge Disproportion and

disproportion and the traditional Mn$^{3+}$/Mn$^{4+}$ picture of the
charge-orbital orders in half-doped manganites is resolved by a novel Wannier
states analysis of the LDA$+U$ electronic structure. Strong electron itinerancy
in this charge-transfer system significantly delocalizes the occupied
low-energy ""Mn$^{3+}$"" Wannier states such that charge leaks into the
""Mn$^{4+}$""-sites. Furthermore, the leading mechanisms of the charge order are
quantified via our first-principles derivation of the low-energy effective
Hamiltonian. The electron-electron interaction is found to play a role as
important as the electron-lattice interaction. \ignore{A general picture of
doped holes in strongly correlated charge-transfer systems is presented and

Direct extraction of one-loop integral coefficients,Darren Forde,"  We present a general procedure for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar
bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are
extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the
corresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific
parameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify the
coefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining the
behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loop
momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar
integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD
and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently
computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude
$A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedure
allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.

60 {\AA}$. The Mott-Hubbard gap of LVO remained open at the interface,
indicating that the interface is insulating unlike the LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$
multilayers. We found that the valence of V in LVO were partially converted
from V$^{3+}$ to V$^{4+}$ only at the interface on the top side of the LVO
layer and that the amount of V$^{4+}$ increased with LVO layer thickness. We
suggest that the electronic reconstruction to eliminate the polarity
catastrophe inherent in the polar heterostructure is the origin of the highly
asymmetric valence change at the LVO/LAO interfaces.

"Performance Analysis of the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed

Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and slotted Binary Exponential
Backoff (BEB) mechanism. We present a simple mathematical analysis framework
for the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed
random access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully
transmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle
time exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via
simulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA
saturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and
packet loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful
substitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.

Simulations of aging and plastic deformation in polymer glasses,Mya Warren and Joerg Rottler,"  We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model
polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is
determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant
uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully
captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including
signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation
timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the
macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire
distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large
changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except
for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be
correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.

Gaseous Inner Disks,"Joan R. Najita, John S. Carr, Alfred E. Glassgold, and Jeff Valenti","  As the likely birthplaces of planets and an essential conduit for the buildup
of stellar masses, inner disks are of fundamental interest in star and planet
formation. Studies of the gaseous component of inner disks are of interest
because of their ability to probe the dynamics, physical and chemical
structure, and gas content of this region. We review the observational and
theoretical developments in this field, highlighting the potential of such
studies to, e.g., measure inner disk truncation radii, probe the nature of the
disk accretion process, and chart the evolution in the gas content of disks.
Measurements of this kind have the potential to provide unique insights on the
physical processes governing star and planet formation.

Fairness Provision in the IEEE 802.11e Infrastructure Basic Service Set,"Feyza Keceli, Inanc Inan, Ender Ayanoglu","  Most of the deployed IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use

a gateway between wired and wireless domains. We present the unfairness problem
between the uplink and the downlink flows of any Access Category (AC) in the
802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) when the default settings of
the EDCA parameters are used. We propose a simple analytical model to calculate
the EDCA parameter settings that achieve weighted fair resource allocation for
all uplink and downlink flows. We also propose a simple model-assisted
measurement-based dynamic EDCA parameter adaptation algorithm. Moreover, our
dynamic solution addresses the differences in the transport layer and the
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer interactions of User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

Window (CW) and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limit adaptation at the AP provides
fair UDP and TCP access between uplink and downlink flows of the same AC while
preserving prioritization among ACs.

"A New Algebraic Structure of Finite Quantum Systems and the Modified
  Bessel Functions",Kazuyuki Fujii (Yokohama City University),"  In this paper we present a new algebraic structure (a super hyperbolic system
in our terminology) for finite quantum systems, which is a generalization of
the usual one in the two-level system.
  It fits into the so-called generalized Pauli matrices, so they play an
important role in the theory. Some deep relation to the modified Bessel

The Lee-Wick Standard Model,"Benjamin Grinstein, Donal O'Connell and Mark B. Wise","  We construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the Higgs
mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections, using ideas
originally discussed by Lee and Wick in the context of a finite theory of
quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrangian includes new higher derivative
operators. We show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by
introducing a set of auxiliary fields; this allows for convenient computation
and makes the physical interpretation more transparent. Although the theory is
unitary, it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions.

Specht modules and Kazhdan--Lusztig cells in type $B_n$,"Meinolf Geck, Lacrimioara Iancu and Christos Pallikaros","  Dipper, James and Murphy generalized the classical Specht module theory to
Hecke algebras of type $B_n$. On the other hand, for any choice of a monomial
order on the parameters in type $B_n$, we obtain corresponding Kazhdan--Lusztig
cell modules. In this paper, we show that the Specht modules are naturally
equivalent to the Kazhdan--Lusztig cell modules {\em if} we choose the
dominance order on the parameters, as in the ``asymptotic case'' studied by
Bonnaf\'e and the second named author. We also give examples which show that
such an equivalence does not hold for other choices of monomial orders.

"Growing Networks: Limit in-degree distribution for arbitrary out-degree
  one",Daniel Fraiman,"  We compute the stationary in-degree probability, $P_{in}(k)$, for a growing
network model with directed edges and arbitrary out-degree probability. In
particular, under preferential linking, we find that if the nodes have a light
tail (finite variance) out-degree distribution, then the corresponding
in-degree one behaves as $k^{-3}$. Moreover, for an out-degree distribution
with a scale invariant tail, $P_{out}(k)\sim k^{-\alpha}$, the corresponding
in-degree distribution has exactly the same asymptotic behavior only if
$2<\alpha<3$ (infinite variance). Similar results are obtained when
attractiveness is included. We also present some results on descriptive
statistics measures %descriptive statistics such as the correlation between the
number of in-going links, $D_{in}$, and outgoing links, $D_{out}$, and the
conditional expectation of $D_{in}$ given $D_{out}$, and we calculate these
measures for the WWW network. Finally, we present an application to the
scientific publications network. The results presented here can explain the
tail behavior of in/out-degree distribution observed in many real networks.

"UV stable, Lorentz-violating dark energy with transient phantom era","Maxim Libanov, Eleftherios Papantonopoulos, Valery Rubakov, M. Sami,
  Shinji Tsujikawa","  Phantom fields with negative kinetic energy are often plagued by the vacuum
quantum instability in the ultraviolet region. We present a Lorentz-violating
dark energy model free from this problem and show that the crossing of the
cosmological constant boundary w=-1 to the phantom equation of state is
realized before reaching a de Sitter attractor. Another interesting feature is
a peculiar time-dependence of the effective Newton's constant; the magnitude of
this effect is naturally small but may be close to experimental limits. We also
derive momentum scales of instabilities at which tachyons or ghosts appear in
the infrared region around the present Hubble scale and clarify the conditions
under which tachyonic instabilities do not spoil homogeneity of the
present/future Universe.

Response of degree-correlated scale-free networks to stimuli,"Sheng-Jun Wang, An-Cai Wu, Zhi-Xi Wu, Xin-Jian Xu, Ying-Hai Wang","  The response of degree-correlated scale-free attractor networks to stimuli is
studied. We show that degree-correlated scale-free networks are robust to
random stimuli as well as the uncorrelated scale-free networks, while
assortative (disassortative) scale-free networks are more (less) sensitive to
directed stimuli than uncorrelated networks. We find that the
degree-correlation of scale-free networks makes the dynamics of attractor
systems different from uncorrelated ones. The dynamics of correlated scale-free
attractor networks result in the effects of degree correlation on the response
to stimuli.

Shock and Release Temperatures in Molybdenum,"Damian C. Swift, Achim Seifter, David B. Holtkamp, David A. Clark","  Shock and release temperatures in Mo were calculated, taking account of
heating from plastic flow predicted using the Steinberg-Guinan model. Plastic
flow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is
necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. The
temperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal
hydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emission
spectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released into
vacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of a
planar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface
velocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked
state; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,
indicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.
The measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that
the fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for
these loading conditions.

Spectrum of the Laplacian on Quaternionic Kahler Manifolds,"Shengli Kong, Peter Li and Detang Zhou","  Let $M^{4n}$ be a complete quaternionic K\""ahler manifold with scalar
curvature bounded below by $-16n(n+2)$. We get a sharp estimate for the first
eigenvalue $\lambda_1(M)$ of the Laplacian which is $\lambda_1(M)\le (2n+1)^2$.
If the equality holds, then either $M$ has only one end, or $M$ is
diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}\times N$ with N given by a compact manifold.
Moreover, if $M$ is of bounded curvature, $M$ is covered by the quaterionic
hyperbolic space $\mathbb{QH}^n$ and $N$ is a compact quotient of the
generalized Heisenberg group. When $\lambda_1(M)\ge \frac{8(n+2)}3$, we also
prove that $M$ must have only one end with infinite volume.

Biased Structural Fluctuations due to Electron Wind Force,"O. Bondarchuk, W.G. Cullen, M. Degawa and Ellen D. Williams","  Direct correlation between temporal structural fluctuations and electron wind
force is demonstrated, for the first time, by STM imaging and analysis of
atomically-resolved motion on a thin film surface under large applied current
(10e5 Amp/sqare cm). The magnitude of the momentum transfer between current
carriers and atoms in the fluctuating structure is at least five to fifteen
times (plus or minus one sigma range) larger than for freely diffusing adatoms.
The corresponding changes in surface resistivity will contribute significant
fluctuation signature to nanoscale electronic properties.

"Dissipation of Magnetic Flux in Primordial Star Formation: From Run-away
  Phase to Mass Accretion Phase",Hideki Maki and Hajime Susa,"  We investigate the dissipation of magnetic flux in primordial star-forming
clouds throughout their collapse including the run-away collapse phase as well
as the accretion phase. We solve the energy equation and the non-equilibrium
chemical reactions in the collapsing gas, in order to obtain the radial
distribution of the ionized fraction during the collapse. As a result, we find
the ionized fraction is high enough for the magnetic field to couple with the
gas throughout the evolution of the cloud. This result suggests that the jet
formation from protostars as well as the activation of magneto-rotational
instability in the accretion disk are enabled in the presence of the
cosmological seed magnetic flux proposed by Langer et al.(2003).

Teaching for transfer,Sanjoy Mahajan,"  Students, after they leave our care, are called to solve the diverse problems
of the world, so we should teach to increase transfer: the ability to apply
fundamental principles to new problems and contexts. This ability is rare. The
following pages are from a workshop for faculty on designing courses that
promote transfer. I discuss two design principles: to name the transferable
ideas and to illustrate them with examples from diverse subjects. The
discussion uses dimensional reasoning as the example of a valuable transferable
idea, illustrating it with three diverse examples.

Variations of the Hidden Sector in a Realistic Intersecting Brane Model,"Ching-Ming Chen, Tianjun Li, V. E. Mayes, Dimitri V. Nanopoulos","  Recently, we discussed the first example of a phenomenologically realistic
intersecting D6-brane model. In this model, the gauge symmetry in the hidden
sector is USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4. However, we find that the
USp(2)_1 x USp(2)_2 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an U(2)_{12} gauge
symmetry, and/or the USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4 gauge symmetry can be replaced by an
U(2)_{34} gauge symmetry since the USp(2)^2 stacks of D6-branes contribute to
the same Ramond-Ramond tadpoles as those of the U(2) stacks. Thus, there are
three non-equivalent variations of the hidden sector, and the corresponding
gauge symmetries are U(2)_{12} x USp(2)_3 x USp(2)_4, U(2)_{34} x USp(2)_1 x
USp(2)_2, and U(2)_{12} x U(2)_{34}, respectively. Moreover, we study the
hidden sector gauge symmetry breaking, discuss how to decouple the additional
exotic particles, and briefly comment on the phenomenological consequences.

Axial Vector Tetraquark with Two s-quarks,"Yoshiko Kanada-En'yo, Osamu Morimatsu and Tetsuo Nishikawa","  Possibility of an axial vector isoscalar tetraquark $ud\bar{s}\bar{s}$ is
discussed. If a $f_1$ meson in the mass region $1.4-1.5$ GeV consists of four
quarks $ns\bar{n}\bar{s}$, the mass of the isoscalar
$ud\bar{s}\bar{s}$($\vartheta^+$-meson) state with $J^P=1^+$ is expected to be
lower than that of the $f_1$ meson. Within a flux-tube quark model, a possible
resonant state of $ud\bar{s}\bar{s}(J^{P}=1^{+})$ is suggested to appear at
$\sim$ 1.4 GeV with the width ${\cal{O}}(20\sim 50)$ MeV. We propose that the
$\vartheta^+$-meson is the good candidate for the tetraquark search, which
would be observed in the $K^+K^+\pi^-$ decay channel.

What is the order of 2D polymer escape transition?,"Hsiao-Ping Hsu, Kurt Binder, Leonid I. Klushin, and Alexander M.
  Skvortsov","  An end-grafted flexible polymer chain in 3d space between two pistons
undergoes an abrupt transition from a confined coil to a flower-like
conformation when the number of monomers in the chain, N, reaches a critical
value. In 2d geometry, excluded volume interactions between monomers of a chain
confined inside a strip of finite length 2L transform the coil conformation
into a linear string of blobs. However, the blob picture raises questions on
the nature of this escape transition. To check the theoretical predictions
based on the blob picture we study 2d single polymer chains with excluded
volume interactions and with one end grafted in the middle of a strip of length
  2L and width H by simulating self-avoiding walks on a square lattice with the
pruned-enriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM). We estimate the free energy, the
end-to-end distance, the number of imprisoned monomers, the order parameter,
and its distribution. It is shown that in the thermodynamic limit of large N
and L but finite L/N, there is a small but finite jump in several average
characteristics, including the order parameter. We also present a theoretical
description based on the Landau free energy approach, which is in good
agreement with the simulation results. Both simulation results and the
analytical theory indicate that the 2d escape transition is a weak first-order
phase transition.

Detecting the Most Distant (z>7) Objects with ALMA,Fabian Walter and Chris Carilli,"  Detecting and studying objects at the highest redshifts, out to the end of
Cosmic Reionization at z>7, is clearly a key science goal of ALMA. ALMA will in
principle be able to detect objects in this redshift range both from high-J
(J>7) CO transitions and emission from ionized carbon, [CII], which is one of
the main cooling lines of the ISM. ALMA will even be able to resolve this
emission for individual targets, which will be one of the few ways to determine
dynamical masses for systems in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss some of
the current problems regarding the detection and characterization of objects at
high redshifts and how ALMA will eliminate most (but not all) of them.

"How Mergers May Affect The Mass Scaling Relations Between Black Holes,
  Galaxies, and Other Gravitationally Bound Systems",Chien Y. Peng (STScI),"  Supermassive black hole (BH) masses (MBH) are strongly correlated with galaxy
stellar bulge masses (Mbulge) and there are several ideas to explain the origin
of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from
considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear
BH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of how
primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function
declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relation
is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation
because of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency for
galaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, and
a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A
curious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges are
formed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH would
correlate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of stronger
central-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if some
other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulge
relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random
merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather
than weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized
to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclear
objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.

Double spin asymmetry in exclusive rho^0 muoproduction at COMPASS,"COMPASS Collaboration, M. Alekseev, et al","  The longitudinal double spin asymmetry A_1^rho for exclusive leptoproduction
of rho^0 mesons, mu + N -> mu + N + rho, is studied using the COMPASS 2002 and

polarised deuterons. The Q^2 and x dependence of A_1^rho is presented in a wide
kinematical range: 3x10^-3 < Q^2 < 7 (GeV/c)^2 and 5x10^-5 < x < 0.05. The
presented results are the first measurements of A_1^rho at small Q2 (Q2 < 0.1

with zero in the whole kinematical range.

High purity bright single photon source,"J. S. Neergaard-Nielsen, B. Melholt Nielsen, H. Takahashi, A. I.

a frequency tunable source of heralded single photons with a narrow bandwidth
of 8 MHz, making it compatible with atomic quantum memories. The photon state
is 70% pure single photon as characterized by a tomographic measurement and
reconstruction of the quantum state, revealing a clearly negative Wigner
function. Furthermore, it has a spectral brightness of ~1,500 photons/s per MHz
bandwidth, making it one of the brightest single photon sources available. We
also investigate the correlation function of the down-converted fields using a
combination of two very distinct detection methods; photon counting and
homodyne measurement.

On $L^{1}$-Convergence of Fourier Series Under $MVBV$ Condition,"Dan Sheng Yu, Ping Zhou and Song Ping Zhou","  Let $f\in L_{2\pi}$ be a real-valued even function with its Fourier series $
\frac{a_{0}}{2}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos nx,$ and let $S_{n}(f,x), n\geq
1,$ be the $n$-th partial sum of the Fourier series. It is well-known that if
the nonnegative sequence $\{a_{n}\}$ is decreasing and $\lim\limits_{n\to
\infty}a_{n}=0$, then $$ \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\Vert f-S_{n}(f)\Vert_{L}=0
{if and only if} \lim\limits_{n\to \infty}a_{n}\log n=0. $$ We weaken the
monotone condition in this classical result to the so-called mean value bounded
variation ($MVBV$) condition. The generalization of the above classical result
in real-valued function space is presented as a special case of the main result
in this paper which gives the $L^{1}$% -convergence of a function $f\in
L_{2\pi}$ in complex space. We also give results on $L^{1}$-approximation of a
function $f\in L_{2\pi}$ under the $% MVBV$ condition.

"On global solution to the Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation below energy

a cubic convolution nonlinearity in $\R^3$. By making use of Bourgain's method
in conjunction with a precise Strichartz estimate of S.Klainerman and D.Tataru,
we establish the $H^s (s<1)$ global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for
the cubic convolution defocusing Klein-Gordon-Hartree equation. Before arriving
at the previously discussed conclusion, we obtain global solution for this
non-scaling equation with small initial data in $H^{s_0}\times H^{s_0-1}$ where
$s_0=\frac\gamma 6$ but not $\frac\gamma2-1$, for this equation that we
consider is a subconformal equation in some sense. In doing so a number of
nonlinear prior estimates are already established by using Bony's
decomposition, flexibility of Klein-Gordon admissible pairs which are slightly
different from that of wave equation and a commutator estimate. We establish
this commutator estimate by exploiting cancellation property and utilizing
Coifman and Meyer multilinear multiplier theorem. As far as we know, it seems
that this is the first result on low regularity for this Klein-Gordon-Hartree
equation.

Band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of Landau-Pekar polarons,"A.E.Myasnikova, E.N. Myasnikov","  We consider decay of phonon condensate into phonons at photodissociation of

Expression to calculate the band in ARPES caused by photodissociation of SCLP

large-radius polarons is a broad band with the shape determined by Poisson
distribution. It can be structured or unstructured depending on the phonon
dispersion since a distance between neighbouring lines comprising the band is
the phonon energy. Half-width of the band is in the interval 1.3 - 1.7Ep,
depending on the phonon energy. The band maximum is situated approximately at
the electron energy Ephot-W-3.2Ep (where Ephot is the photon energy, W is work
function), and its position does not depend on the electron wave vector
direction.

"Electromagnetic Pulse Propagation over Nonuniform Earth Surface:
  Numerical Simulation",Alexei V. Popov and Vladimir V. Kopeikin,"  We simulate EM pulse propagation along the nonuniform earth surface using so
called time-domain parabolic equation. To solve it by finite differences, we
introduce a time-domain analog of the impedance boundary condition and a
nonlocal BC of transparency reducing open computational domain to a strip of
finite width. Numerical examples demonstrate influence of soil conductivity on
the wide-band pulse waveform. For a high-frequency modulated EM pulse, we
develop an asymptotic approach based on the ray structure of the monochromatic
wave field at carrier frequency. This radically diminishes the computation
costs and allows for pulsed wave field calculation in vast domains measured by
tens of thousands wavelengths.

Simulation of Graphene Nanoribbon Field Effect Transistors,G. Fiori and G. Iannaccone,"  We present an atomistic three-dimensional simulation of graphene nanoribbon

the 3D Poisson and Schroedinger equation with open boundary conditions within
the non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism and a tight-binding hamiltonian.
With respect to carbon nanotube FETs, GNR-FETs exhibit comparable performance,
reduced sensitivity on the variability of channel chirality, and similar
leakage problems due to band-to-band tunneling. Acceptable transistor
performance requires effective nanoribbon width of 1-2 nm, that could be
obtained with periodic etching patterns or stress patterns.

"Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory: Kinetic Potentials and Ab-Initio
  Local Pseudopotentials",Jeng-Da Chai and John D Weeks,"  In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy of
the ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general external
field is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt to
calculate this directly from the electron density by approximating the
universal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple local
approximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devise
generally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kinetic
potential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears in
the Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kinetic
potential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivated
approximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which the
value of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose two
nonlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms for
both slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exact
results for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system to
small perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurate
and weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varying
valence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital free
DF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these local
pseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kinetic
potentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionization
energies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial density
profiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the full
Kohn-Sham theory.

Quantum Quenches in Extended Systems,"Pasquale Calabrese, John Cardy","  We study in general the time-evolution of correlation functions in a extended
quantum system after the quench of a parameter in the hamiltonian. We show that
correlation functions in d dimensions can be extracted using methods of
boundary critical phenomena in d+1 dimensions. For d=1 this allows to use the
powerful tools of conformal field theory in the case of critical evolution.
Several results are obtained in generic dimension in the gaussian (mean-field)
approximation. These predictions are checked against the real-time evolution of
some solvable models that allows also to understand which features are valid
beyond the critical evolution.
  All our findings may be explained in terms of a picture generally valid,
whereby quasiparticles, entangled over regions of the order of the correlation
length in the initial state, then propagate with a finite speed through the
system. Furthermore we show that the long-time results can be interpreted in
terms of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. We discuss some open questions and
possible future developments.

Statistical Properties of Many Particle Eigenfunctions,Eric J. Heller and Brian R. Landry,"  Wavefunction correlations and density matrices for few or many particles are
derived from the properties of semiclassical energy Green functions. Universal
features of fixed energy (microcanonical) random wavefunction correlation
functions appear which reflect the emergence of the canonical ensemble as the
number of particles approaches infinity. This arises through a little known
asymptotic limit of Bessel functions. Constraints due to symmetries,
boundaries, and collisions between particles can be included.

The power of choice in network growth,"Raissa M. D'Souza, Paul L. Krapivsky, Cristopher Moore","  The ""power of choice"" has been shown to radically alter the behavior of a
number of randomized algorithms. Here we explore the effects of choice on
models of tree and network growth. In our models each new node has k randomly
chosen contacts, where k > 1 is a constant. It then attaches to whichever one
of these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance from
the root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., when
k=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.
For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to the
root of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to a
traveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with the
smallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a random
graph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network with
degree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to the
contact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is a
power law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with an
exponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see a
power law over a wide range of degrees.

"Evolution favors protein mutational robustness in sufficiently large
  populations","Jesse D. Bloom, Zhongyi Lu, David Chen, Alpan Raval, Ophelia S.
  Venturelli, and Frances H. Arnold","  BACKGROUND: An important question is whether evolution favors properties such
as mutational robustness or evolvability that do not directly benefit any
individual, but can influence the course of future evolution. Functionally
similar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and
capacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of
these differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.
  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution
favors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently
large. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection
pressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that
proteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards
higher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve
greater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both
mutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and
stability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be
quantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral
network.
  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general
tendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in
highly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute
to the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that
exist in large populations.

An algebraic generalization of Kripke structures,S\'ergio Marcelino and Pedro Resende,"  The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made
algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of
pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the
traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it
suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the
applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as
foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse
semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics
for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization
for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As
additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the
logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.

Origin of the 60K plateau in YBa_2Cu_3O_6+x,V. M. Matic and N. Dj. Lazarov,"  A model for charge transfer mechanism in YBa2Cu3O6+x high-Tc cuprate based on
critical chain length concept is proposed to account for 60K and 90K plateaus
in Tc(x) dependence. It has been shown, when the statistics of CuO chain
formation was described in terms of two dimensional asymmetric next-to-nearest
neighbor Ising (ASYNNNI) model, that at any constant temperature below the top
of OII phase there exists a uniquely defined value of critical chain length
lcr(T) that yields a constant doping p(x)=const over the regime of OII phase
(related to 60K plateau of Tc(x)), while 90K plateau coincides with the
monotonously increasing p(x) over optimal doping level p=0.16 in the regime of
OI phase. Short length chains (l<lcr(T)), together with the first lcr(T)-2
holes in longer chains (l>lcr(T)), are taken as not capable of attracting
electrons from CuO2 planes.. It is shown that only a part (41%) of the
remaining l-lcr(T)+1 holes in the long chains can capture electrons. The
results obtained indicate that the ASYNNNI model and two-plateaus-like behavior
of Tc(x) in YBa2Cu3O6+x are closely connected.

N-homogeneous superalgebras,"Phung Ho Hai, Benoit Kriegk and Martin Lorenz","  We develop the theory of N-homogeneous algebras in a super setting, with
particular emphasis on the Koszul property. To any Hecke operator on a vector
superspace, we associate certain superalgebras and generalizing the ordinary
symmetric and Grassmann algebra, respectively. We prove that these algebras are
N-Koszul. For the special case where the Hecke operator is the ordinary
supersymmetry, we derive an $N$-generalized super-version of MacMahon's
classical ""master theorem"".

"First and second sound modes at finite temperature in trapped Fermi
  gases from BCS to BEC","Yan He, Qijin Chen, Chih-Chun Chien, and K. Levin","  We determine the temperature $T$ dependence of first and second sound mode
frequencies for trapped Fermi gases undergoing BCS to Bose Einstein
condensation (BEC) crossover. Our results are based on the two fluid equations
in conjunction with a microscopic calculation of thermodynamical variables. As
in experiment and at unitarity, we show that the lowest radial breathing mode
is $T$ independent. At finite $T$, higher order breathing modes strongly mix
with second sound. Their complex $T$ dependence should provide an alternative
way of measuring the transition temperature, $T_c$.

  non-monotonic lateral forces and failure of proximity-force approximations","Alejandro Rodriguez, Mihai Ibanescu, Davide Iannuzzi, Federico
  Capasso, John D. Joannopoulos, and Steven G. Johnson","  We present a method of computing Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries,
with any desired accuracy, that can directly exploit the efficiency of standard
numerical-electromagnetism techniques. Using the simplest possible
finite-difference implementation of this approach, we obtain both agreement
with past results for cylinder-plate geometries, and also present results for
new geometries. In particular, we examine a piston-like problem involving two
dielectric and metallic squares sliding between two metallic walls, in two and
three dimensions, respectively, and demonstrate non-additive and non-monotonic
changes in the force due to these lateral walls.

"Elastic properties of vanadium pentoxide aggregates and topological
  defects",L. V. Elnikova,"  We study the aqueous solution of vanadium pentoxide by using topology
methods. The experiments by Zocher, Kaznacheev, and Dogic exhibited, that in
the sol phases of $V_2O_5-H_2O$, the tactoid droplets of $V_2O_5$ can coalesce.
In the magnetic field, this effect is associated with a gauge field action,
viz. we consider coalescence (in the topologically more convenient term,
""junction"") of droplets as annihilation of topological defects, concerning with
the tactoid geometry. We have shown, that in the magnetic field, the tactoid
junction is mainly caused by non-Abelian monopoles (vortons), whereas the
Abelian defects almost do not annihilate. Taking into account this annihilation
mechanism, the estimations of time-aging of the $V_2O_5-H_2O$ sols may be
specified

"Non-Associativity of Lorentz Transformation and Associative Reflection
  Symmetric Transformation",Mushfiq Ahmad and M. Shah Alam,"  Each of the two moving observers observes the relative velocity of the other.

also shown that the reason is that Lorentz transformation is not associative.
Reciprocal symmetric transformation is associative and fulfills relativistic
requirements.

Jamming dynamics in grain mixtures : An extended hydrodynamic approach,Supurna Sinha,"  We study jamming in granular mixtures from the novel point of view of
extended hydrodynamics. Using a hard sphere binary mixture model we predict
that a few large grains are expected to get caged more effectively in a matrix
of small grains compared to a few small grains in a matrix of larger ones. A
similar effect has been experimentally seen in the context of colloidal
mixtures.

Path Distinguishability in Double Scattering of Light by Atoms,"Christian Miniatura, Cord A. M\""uller, Yin Lu, Guangquan Wang,
  Berthold-Georg Englert","  Wave-particle duality finds a natural application for electrons or light
propagating in disordered media where coherent corrections to transport are
given by two-wave interference. For scatterers with internal degrees of
freedom, these corrections are observed to be much smaller than would be
expected for structureless scatterers. By examining the basic example of the
scattering of one photon by two spin-1/2 atoms--a case-study for coherent
backscattering--we demonstrate that the loss of interference strength is
associated with which-path information stored by the scattering atoms.

"Constraints on transmission, dispersion, and density of states in
  dielectric multilayers and stepwise potential barriers with arbitrary layer
  arrangement","S. V. Zhukovsky, S. V. Gaponenko","  Normal-incidence transmission and dispersion properties of optical
multilayers and one-dimensional stepwise potential barriers in the
non-tunneling regime are analytically investigated. The optical paths of every
constituent layer in a multilayer structure, as well as the parameters of every
step of the stepwise potential barrier, are constrained by a generalized
quarter-wave condition. No other restrictions on the structure geometry is
imposed, i.e., the layers are arranged arbitrarily. We show that the density of
states (DOS) spectra of the multilayer or barrier in question are subject to
integral conservation rules similar to the Barnett-Loudon sum rule but ocurring
within a finite frequency or energy interval. In the optical case, these
frequency intervals are regular. For the potential barriers, only non-periodic
energy intervals can be present in the spectrum of any given structure, and
only if the parameters of constituent potential steps are properly chosen.
  Abstract The integral conservation relations derived analytically have also
been verified numerically. The relations can be used in dispersion-engineered
multilayer-based devices, e.g., ultrashort pulse compressors or ultracompact
optical delay lines, as well as to design multiple-quantum-well electronic
heterostructures with engineered DOS.

"Electromagnetic Casimir densities for a wedge with a coaxial cylindrical
  shell",A.A. Saharian,"  Vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor
for the electromagnetic field are investigated for the geometry of a wedge with
a coaxal cylindrical boundary. All boundaries are assumed to be perfectly
conducting and both regions inside and outside the shell are considered. By
using the generalized Abel-Plana formula, the vacuum expectation values are
presented in the form of the sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the
geometry of the wedge without the cylindrical shell and the second term is
induced by the presence of the shell. The vacuum energy density induced by the
shell is negative for the interior region and is positive for the exterior
region. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum expectation values are
investigated in various limiting cases. It is shown that the vacuum forces
acting on the wedge sides due to the presence of the cylindrical boundary are
always attractive.

Progenitors of Long Gamma-ray Bursts,"Melvyn B. Davies, Andrew J. Levan, Josefin Larsson, Andrew R. King,
  Andrew S. Fruchter","  Pinpointing the progenitors of long duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) remains
an extremely important question, although it is now clear that at least a
fraction of LGRBs originate in the core collapse of massive stars in type Ic
supernovae, the pathways to the production of these stars, and their initial
masses, remain uncertain. Rotation is thought to be vital in the creation of
LGRBs, and it is likely that black hole creation is also necessary. We suggest
that these two constraints can be met if the GRB progenitors are very massive
stars (>20 solar masses) and are formed in tight binary systems. Using simple
models we compare the predictions of this scenario with observations and find
that the location of GRBs on their host galaxies are suggestive of
main-sequence masses in excess of 20 solar masses, while 50% of the known
compact binary systems may have been sufficiently close to have had the
necessary rotation rates for GRB creation. Thus, massive stars in compact
binaries are a likely channel for at least some fraction of LGRBs.

Causal vs. Analytic constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings,Luca Vecchi,"  We derive one loop constraints on the anomalous quartic gauge couplings using
a general non-forward dispersion relation for the elastic scattering amplitude
of two longitudinally polarized vector bosons. We compare this result with
another one derived by the assumption that the underlying theory satisfies the
causality principle of Special Relativity and show that this latter is more
constraining.

Classical Information Capacity of the Bosonic Broadcast Channel,"Saikat Guha, Jeffrey H. Shapiro","  We show that when coherent-state encoding is employed in conjunction with
coherent detection, the Bosonic broadcast channel is equivalent to a classical
degraded Gaussian broadcast channel whose capacity region is dual to that of
the classical Gaussian multiple-access channel. We further show that if a
minimum output-entropy conjecture holds true, then the ultimate classical
information capacity of the Bosonic broadcast channel can be achieved by a
coherent-state encoding. We provide some evidence in support of the conjecture.

"Interplay of Anisotropy and Disorder in the Doping-Dependent Melting and
  Glass Transitions of Vortices in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$","H. Beidenkopf, T. Verdene, Y. Myasoedov, H. Shtrikman, E. Zeldov, B.
  Rosenstein, D. Li, T. Tamegai","  We study the oxygen doping dependence of the equilibrium first-order melting
and second-order glass transitions of vortices in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Doping affects both anisotropy and
disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where
thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks
that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to
melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model
further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser
degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.

"Growth window and possible mechanism of millimeter-thick single-walled
  carbon nanotube forests","Kei Hasegawa, Suguru Noda, Hisashi Sugime, Kazunori Kakehi, Shigeo
  Maruyama, Yukio Yamaguchi","  Our group recently reproduced the water-assisted growth method, so-called
""super growth"", of millimeter-thick single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)
forests by using C2H4/ H2/ H2O/ Ar reactant gas and Fe/ Al2O3 catalyst. In this
current work, a parametric study was carried out on both reaction and catalyst
conditions. Results revealed that a thin Fe catalyst layer (about 0.5 nm)
yielded rapid growth of SWNTs only when supported on Al2O3, and that Al2O3
support enhanced the activity of Fe, Co, and Ni catalysts. The growth window
for the rapid SWNT growth was narrow, however. Optimum amount of added H2O
increased the SWNT growth rate but further addition of H2O degraded both the
SWNT growth rate and quality. Addition of H2 was also essential for rapid SWNT
growth, but again, further addition decreased both the SWNT growth rate and
quality. Because Al2O3 catalyzes hydrocarbon reforming, Al2O3 support possibly
enhances the SWNT growth rate by supplying the carbon source to the catalyst
nanoparticles. The origin of the narrow window for rapid SWNT growth will also
be discussed.

Nonlocal interactions versus viscosity in turbulence,A. Bershadskii,"  It is shown that nonlocal interactions determine energy spectrum in isotropic
turbulence at small Reynolds numbers. It is also shown that for moderate
Reynolds numbers the bottleneck effect is determined by the same nonlocal
interactions. Role of the large and small scales covariance at the nonlocal
interactions and in energy balance has been investigated. A possible
hydrodynamic mechanism of the nonlocal solution instability at large scales has
been briefly discussed. A quantitative relationship between effective strain of
the nonlocal interactions and viscosity has been found. All results are
supported by comparison with the data of experiments and numerical simulations.

Quantum radiative corrections to slow-roll inflation,Ante Bilandzic (Nikhef) and Tomislav Prokopec (Utrecht University),"  We consider the nonminimally coupled lambda phi^4 scalar field theory in de
Sitter space and construct the renormalization group improved renormalized
effective theory at the one-loop level. Based on the corresponding quantum
Friedmann equation and the scalar field equation of motion, we calculate the
quantum radiative corrections to the scalar spectral index n_s, gravitational
wave spectral index n_g and the ratio r of tensor to scalar perturbations. When
compared with the standard (tree-level) values, we find that the quantum
contributions are suppressed by lambda N^2 where N denotes the number of
e-foldings. Hence there is an N^2 enhancement with respect to the naive
expectation, which is due to the infrared enhancement of scalar vacuum
fluctuations characterising de Sitter space. Since observations constrain
lambda to be very small lambda ~ 10^(-12) and N ~ 50-60, the quantum
corrections in this inflationary model are unobservably small.

"Ab initio wavefunction based methods for excited states in solids:
  correlation corrections to the band structure of ionic oxides","L. Hozoi, U. Birkenheuer, P. Fulde, A. Mitrushchenkov, and H. Stoll","  Ab initio wavefunction based methods are applied to the study of electron
correlation effects on the band structure of oxide systems. We choose MgO as a
prototype closed-shell ionic oxide. Our analysis is based on a local
Hamiltonian approach and performed on finite fragments cut from the infinite
solid. Localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials are obtained from
prior periodic Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations. We investigate the role of
various electron correlation effects in reducing the HF band gap and modifying
the band widths. On-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation as well as
long-range polarization effects are calculated. Whereas correlation effects are
essential for computing accurate band gaps, we found that they produce smaller
changes on the HF band widths, at least for this material. Surprisingly, a
broadening effect is obtained for the O 2p valence bands. The ab initio data
are in good agreement with the energy gap and band width derived from
thermoreflectance and x-ray photoemission experiments. The results show that
the wavefunction based approach applied here allows for well controlled
approximations and a transparent identification of the microscopic processes
which determine the electronic band structure.

"Abundances in intermediate-mass AGB stars undergoing third dredge-up and
  hot-bottom burning","J. A. McSaveney, P. R. Wood, M. Scholz, J. C. Lattanzio and K. H.
  Hinkle","  High dispersion near-infrared spectra have been taken of seven
highly-evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 Msun) AGB stars in the LMC and
SMC in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from
third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been
modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have
been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two
stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared
with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very
large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first
observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen
by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in
intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the
remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had
strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the
line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence
allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations
should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.

Non-linear electromagnetic response of graphene,S. A. Mikhailov,"  It is shown that the massless energy spectrum of electrons and holes in
graphene leads to the strongly non-linear electromagnetic response of this

frequency multiplier. The operating frequency of the graphene frequency
multiplier can lie in a broad range from microwaves to the infrared.

"Ellipsoidal Oscillations Induced by Substellar Companions: A Prospect
  for the Kepler Mission","Eric Pfahl (KITP), Phil Arras (UVa), Bill Paxton (KITP)","  Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered with
the Kepler satellite. Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access to
low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical
processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the
tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression
for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We
demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,
nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula
works extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convection
zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to
the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\ga$10
times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses
considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by
adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white
dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal
lightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest
that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from
as many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)

"Motor driven microtubule shape fluctuations - force from within the
  lattice",Herve Mohrbach and Igor M. Kulic,"  We develop a general theory of microtubule (MT) deformations by molecular
motors generating internal force doublets within the MT lattice. We describe
two basic internal excitations, the S and V shape, and compare them with
experimental observations from literature. We explain the special role of
tubulin vacancies and the dramatic deformation amplifying effect observed for
katanin acting at positions of defects. Experimentally observed shapes are used
to determine the ratio of MT shear and stretch moduli ($\approx
6\times10^{-5}$) and to estimate the forces induced in the MT lattice by
katanin (10's of pN). For many motors acting on a single MT we derive
expressions for the end-to-end distance reduction and provide criteria for
dominance of this new effect over thermal fluctuations. We conclude that
molecular motors if acting cooperatively can ''animate'' MTs from within the
lattice and induce slack even without cross-bridging to other structures, a
scenario very much reminiscent of the motor driven axoneme.

"Effective Lagrangian for the $\chi^{+}_j \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$ interaction
  in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and neutral Higgs decays",Tarek Ibrahim,"  We extend previous analyses of the supersymmetric loop correction to the
neutral Higgs couplings to include the coupling $\chi^{+}_j \chi^{-}_kH^{0}_l$.
The analysis completes the previous analyses where similar corrections were
computed for the $\bar{\tau} \tau H^{0}_l$, $\bar{b} b H^{0}_l$, $\bar{c} c
H^{0}_l$ and for $\bar{t} t H^{0}_l$ couplings within the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. The effective one loop Lagrangian is then
applied to the computation of the neutral Higgs decays. The sizes of the
supersymmetric loop corrections of the neutral Higgs decay widths into
$\chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ ($i=1,2$; $j=1,2$) are investigated and the
supersymmetric loop correction is found to be in the range of $7\sim15%$ in
significant regions of the parameter space. By including the loop corrections
of the other decay channels $\bar{b} b$, $\bar{t} t$, $\bar{\tau} \tau$,
$\bar{c} c$, and $\chi^0_i \chi^0_j$ ($i=1-4$; $j=1-4$), the corrections to
branching ratios for $H^{0}_l\to \chi^{+}_i \chi^{-}_j$ can reach as high as
40%.
  The effects of CP phases on the branching ratio are also investigated.

  Dell'oro (INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico Di Torino), Alan W. Harris (DLR
  Institute of Planetary Research), Stefano Mottola (DLR Institute of Planetary
  Research), Michael Mueller (DLR Institute of Planetary Research)","  Thermal inertia determines the temperature distribution over the surface of
an asteroid and therefore governs the magnitude the Yarkovsky effect. The
latter causes gradual drifting of the orbits of km-sized asteroids and plays an
important role in the delivery of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from the main
belt and in the dynamical spreading of asteroid families. At present, very
little is known about the thermal inertia of asteroids in the km size range.
Here we show that the average thermal inertia of a sample of NEAs in the
km-size range is 200 $\pm$ 40 J m&#8722;2 s&#8722;0.5 K&#8722;1. Furthermore,
we identify a trend of increasing thermal inertia with decreasing asteroid
diameter, D. This indicates that the dependence of the drift rate of the
orbital semimajor axis on the size of asteroids due to the Yarkovsky effect is
a more complex function than the generally adopted D^(&#8722;1) dependence, and
that the size distribution of objects injected by Yarkovsky-driven orbital
mobility into the NEA source regions is less skewed to smaller sizes than
generally assumed. We discuss how this fact may help to explain the small
difference in the slope of the size distribution of km-sized NEAs and main-belt
asteroids.

Strong enhancement of transport by interaction on contact links,Dan Bohr and Peter Schmitteckert,"  Strong repulsive interactions within a one dimensional Fermi system in a
two-probe configuration normally lead to a reduced off-resonance conductance.
We show that if the repulsive interaction extends to the contact regions, a
strong increase of the conductance may occur, even for systems where one would
expect to find a reduced conductance. An essential ingredient in our
calculations is a momentum-space representation of the leads, which allows a
high energy resolution. Further, we demonstrate that these results are
independent of the high-energy cutoff and that the relevant scale is set by the
Fermi velocity.

Quantum Filtering of Optical Coherent States,"C. Wittmann, D. Elser, U. L. Andersen, R. Filip, P. Marek, G. Leuchs","  We propose and experimentally demonstrate non-destructive and noiseless
removal (filtering) of vacuum states from an arbitrary set of coherent states
of continuous variable systems. Errors i.e. vacuum states in the quantum
information are diagnosed through a weak measurement, and on that basis,
probabilistically filtered out. We consider three different filters based on
on/off detection phase stabilized and phase randomized homodyne detection. We
find that on/off etection, optimal in the ideal theoretical setting, is
superior to the homodyne strategy in a practical setting.

"Interpreting and predicting the yield of transit surveys: Giant planets
  in the OGLE fields","Francois Fressin (LG), Tristan Guillot (OCA), Vincent Morello (OCA),
  Fr\'ed\'eric Pont","  Transiting extrasolar planets are now discovered jointly by photometric
surveys and by radial velocimetry. We want to determine whether the different
data sets are compatible between themselves and with models of the evolution of
extrasolar planets. We simulate directly a population of stars corresponding to
the OGLE transit survey and assign them planetary companions based on radial
velocimetry discoveries. We use a model of the evolution and structure of giant
planets assuming a variable fraction of heavy elements. The output list of
detectable planets of the simulations is compared to the real detections. We
confirm that the radial velocimetry and photometric survey data sets are
compatible within the statistical errors, assuming that planets with periods
between 1 and 2 days are approximately 5 times less frequent than planets with
periods between 2 and 5 days. We show that evolution models fitting present
observational constraints predict a lack of small giant planets with large
masses. We also identify distinct populations of planets: those with short
periods (P < 10d) are only found in orbit around metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] >
-0.07. We further confirm the relative absence of low-mass giant planets at
small orbital distances.

"Global Disk Oscillation Modes in Cataclysmic Variables and Other
  Newtonian Accretors","Manuel Ortega-Rodriguez, Robert V. Wagoner","  Diskoseismology, the theoretical study of small adiabatic hydrodynamical
global perturbations of geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks
around black holes (and other compact objects), is a potentially powerful probe
of the gravitational field. For instance, the frequencies of the normal mode
oscillations can be used to determine the elusive angular momentum parameter of
the black hole. The general formalism developed by diskoseismologists for
relativistic systems can be readily applied to the Newtonian case of
cataclysmic variables (CVs). Some of these systems (e.g., the dwarf nova SS
Cygni) show rapid oscillations in the UV with periods of tens of seconds and
high coherence. In this paper, we assess the possibility that these dwarf nova
oscillations (DNOs) are diskoseismic modes. Besides its importance in
investigating the physical origin of DNOs, the present work could help us to
answer the following question. To what extent are the similarities in the
oscillation phenomenology of CVs and X-ray binaries (XRBs) indicative of a
common physical mechanism?

"Quantum molecular dynamics study of the pressure dependence of the

frequency with gas pressure has been a problem of lively interest for over
seventy years. A simple quantum model of the ammonia molecule perturbed by
collisions with ideal gas molecules displays the essential features of the
experimental data for NH3 and for ND3. The model does not display the behaviour
expected from theories of quantum localisation such as quantum state diffusion
and decoherence. On the other hand, models of perturbed classical oscillators
do display similar behaviour to our model. The quenching of the ammonia
inversion transition cannot therefore be interpreted as spatial localisation of
the wavefunction.

"Relative Rigidity, Quasiconvexity and C-Complexes",Mahan Mj,"  We introduce and study the notion of relative rigidity for pairs $(X,\JJ)$
where 1) $X$ is a hyperbolic metric space and $\JJ$ a collection of quasiconvex
sets 2) $X$ is a relatively hyperbolic group and $\JJ$ the collection of
parabolics 3) $X$ is a higher rank symmetric space and $\JJ$ an equivariant
collection of maximal flats Relative rigidity can roughly be described as
upgrading a uniformly proper map between two such $\JJ$'s to a quasi-isometry
between the corresponding $X$'s.
  A related notion is that of a $C$-complex which is the adaptation of a Tits
complex to this context. We prove the relative rigidity of the collection of
pairs $(X, \JJ)$ as above. This generalises a result of Schwarz for symmetric
patterns of geodesics in hyperbolic space. We show that a uniformly proper map
induces an isomorphism of the corresponding $C$-complexes. We also give a
couple of characterizations of quasiconvexity. of subgroups of hyperbolic

"Theory of enhanced second-harmonic generation by the quadrupole-dipole
  hybrid exciton",Oleksiy Roslyak and Joseph L. Birman,"  We report calculated substantial enhancement of the second harmonic
generation (SHG) in cuprous oxide crystals resonantly hybridized with an
appropriate organic material (DCM2:CA:PS 'solid-state solvent'). The quadrupole
origin of the inorganic part of the quadrupole-dipole hybrid provides inversion
symmetry breaking and the organic part contributes to the oscillator strength
of the hybrid. We show that the enhancement of the SHG, compared to bulk
cuprous oxide crystal, is proportional to the ratio of the DCM2 dipole moment
and the effective dipole moment of the quadrupole transitions in the cuprous
oxide. It is also inversely proportional to the line-width of the hybrid and
bulk excitons. The enhancement may be regulated by adjusting the organic blend
(mutual concentration of the DCM2 and CA part of the solvent) and pumping
conditions(varying the angle of incidence in case of optical pumping or
populating the minimum of the lower branch of the hybrid in case of electrical
pumping).

"Error Estimation and Atomistic-Continuum Adaptivity for the
  Quasicontinuum Approximation of a Frenkel-Kontorova Model","Marcel Arndt, Mitchell Luskin","  We propose and analyze a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimator for the
atomistic-continuum modeling error in the quasicontinuum method. Based on this
error estimator, we develop an algorithm which adaptively determines the
atomistic and continuum regions to compute a quantity of interest to within a
given tolerance. We apply the algorithm to the computation of the structure of
a crystallographic defect described by a Frenkel-Kontorova model and present
the results of numerical experiments. The numerical results show that our
method gives an efficient estimate of the error and a nearly optimal
atomistic-continuum modeling strategy.

"Blind Identification of Distributed Antenna Systems with Multiple
  Carrier Frequency Offsets","Yuanning Yu, Athina P. Petropulu and H. Vincent Poor","  In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal
contains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch
between the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
at the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind
CFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal
is over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled
versions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a
distinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO
can be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated
MIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to
initialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually
linked with PLL.

"The Distribution of the first Eigenvalue Spacing at the Hard Edge of the
  Laguerre Unitary Ensemble",Peter J. Forrester and Nicholas S. Witte,"  The distribution function for the first eigenvalue spacing in the Laguerre
unitary ensemble of finite rank random matrices is found in terms of a
Painlev\'e V system, and the solution of its associated linear isomonodromic
system. In particular it is characterised by the polynomial solutions to the
isomonodromic equations which are also orthogonal with respect to a deformation
of the Laguerre weight. In the scaling to the hard edge regime we find an
analogous situation where a certain Painlev\'e \IIId system and its associated
linear isomonodromic system characterise the scaled distribution. We undertake
extensive analytical studies of this system and use this knowledge to
accurately compute the distribution and its moments for various values of the
parameter $ a $. In particular choosing $ a=\pm 1/2 $ allows the first
eigenvalue spacing distribution for random real orthogonal matrices to be
computed.

"Second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids: Relativistic effects
  of pressure, multi-component, curvature, and rotation",J. Hwang and H. Noh,"  We present general relativistic correction terms appearing in Newton's
gravity to the second-order perturbations of cosmological fluids. In our
previous work we have shown that to the second-order perturbations, the density
and velocity perturbation equations of general relativistic zero-pressure,
irrotational, single-component fluid in a flat background coincide exactly with
the ones known in Newton's theory. Here, we present the general relativistic
second-order correction terms arising due to (i) pressure, (ii)
multi-component, (iii) background curvature, and (iv) rotation. In case of
multi-component zero-pressure, irrotational fluids under the flat background,
we effectively do not have relativistic correction terms, thus the relativistic
result again coincides with the Newtonian ones. In the other three cases we
generally have pure general relativistic correction terms. In case of pressure,
the relativistic corrections appear even in the level of background and linear
perturbation equations. In the presence of background curvature, or rotation,
pure relativistic correction terms directly appear in the Newtonian equations
of motion of density and velocity perturbations to the second order. In the
small-scale limit (far inside the horizon), relativistic equations including
the rotation coincide with the ones in Newton's gravity.

Highly turbulent solutions of LANS-alpha and their LES potential,"J. Pietarila Graham (1 and 2), Darryl Holm (3 and 4), Pablo Mininni (1

  National Laboratory, Los Alamos, USA (5) Departamento de Fisica, Universidad
  de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina)","  We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model
(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have
previously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to
observe a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial
range. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the
predicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy
spectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as
k^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the
sub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure
in the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in
different spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is
subdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible
for the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no
internal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS
attractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either
for arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a
formulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully
converged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct
numerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance
between truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead
of the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS
contributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower
energy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude
LANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.

Reentrant Orbital Order and the True Ground State of LaSr2Mn2O7,"Qing'An Li, K.E. Gray, H. Zheng, H. Claus, S. Rosenkranz, S. Nyborg
  Ancona, R. Osborn, J.F. Mitchell, Y. Chen, and J.W. Lynn","  Contrary to conventional wisdom, our purified La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7 crystals
exhibit CE-type orbital and charge order as the low-temperature ground state
for a hole doping level h = 0.5. For small deviations from h = 0.5, the high
temperature CE phase is replaced at low temperatures by an A-type
antiferromagnet without coexistence. Larger deviations result in a lack of CE
order at any temperature. Thus, small inhomogeneities in cation or oxygen
composition could explain why others commonly see this reentrance with
coexistence.

Weak non-linearities and cluster states,"Sebastien G.R. Louis, Kae Nemoto, W.J. Munro and T.P. Spiller","  We propose a scalable approach to building cluster states of matter qubits
using coherent states of light. Recent work on the subject relies on the use of
single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes have a low
initial success probability and low detector efficiencies cause a serious
blowup in resources. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and
highly efficient measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a simple
homodyne measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success
probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing
this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost
and the time scaling, showing how these can be vastly improved with access to
this new probability range.

A discriminating probe of gravity at cosmological scales,"Pengjie Zhang (SHAO), Michele Liguori (Cambridge), Rachel Bean
  (Cornell), Scott Dodelson (Fermilab/Chicago)","  The standard cosmological model is based on general relativity and includes
dark matter and dark energy. An important prediction of this model is a fixed
relationship between the gravitational potentials responsible for gravitational
lensing and the matter overdensity. Alternative theories of gravity often make
different predictions for this relationship. We propose a set of measurements
which can test the lensing/matter relationship, thereby distinguishing between
dark energy/matter models and models in which gravity differs from general
relativity. Planned optical, infrared and radio galaxy and lensing surveys will
be able to measure $E_G$, an observational quantity whose expectation value is
equal to the ratio of the Laplacian of the Newtonian potentials to the peculiar
velocity divergence, to percent accuracy. We show that this will easily
separate alternatives such as $\Lambda$CDM, DGP, TeVeS and $f(R)$ gravity.

"The Loewner driving function of trajectory arcs of quadratic
  differentials",Jonathan Tsai,"  We obtain a first order differential equation for the driving function of the
chordal Loewner differential equation in the case where the domain is slit by a
curve which is a trajectory arc of certain quadratic differentials. In
particular this includes the case when the curve is a path on the square,
triangle or hexagonal lattice in the upper halfplane or, indeed, in any domain
with boundary on the lattice. We also demonstrate how we use this to calculate
the driving function numerically. Equivalent results for other variants of the
Loewner differential equation are also obtained: Multiple slits in the chordal
Loewner differential equation and the radial Loewner differential equation. The
method also works for other versions of the Loewner differential equation. The
proof of our formula uses a generalization of Schwarz-Christoffel mapping to
domains bounded by trajectory arcs of rotations of a given quadratic
differential that is of interest in its own right.
"
On the measurement problem for a two-level quantum system,Alexey A. Kryukov,"  A geometric approach to quantum mechanics with unitary evolution and
non-unitary collapse processes is developed. In this approach the Schrodinger
evolution of a quantum system is a geodesic motion on the space of states of
the system furnished with an appropriate Riemannian metric. The measuring
device is modeled by a perturbation of the metric. The process of measurement
is identified with a geodesic motion of state of the system in the perturbed
metric. Under the assumption of random fluctuations of the perturbed metric,
the Born rule for probabilities of collapse is derived. The approach is applied
to a two-level quantum system to obtain a simple geometric interpretation of
quantum commutators, the uncertainty principle and Planck's constant. In light
of this, a lucid analysis of the double-slit experiment with collapse and an
experiment on a pair of entangled particles is presented.

Global-String and Vortex Superfluids in a Supersymmetric Scenario,"C. N. Ferreira, J. A. Helayel-Neto, W. G. Ney","  The main goal of this work is to investigate the possibility of finding the
supersymmetric version of the U(1)-global string model which behaves as a
vortex-superfluid. To describe the superfluid phase, we introduce a
Lorentz-symmetry breaking background that, in an approach based on
supersymmetry, leads to a discussion on the relation between the violation of
Lorentz symmetry and explicit soft supersymmetry breakings. We also study the
relation between the string configuration and the vortex-superfluid phase. In
the framework we settle down in terms of superspace and superfields, we
actually establish a duality between the vortex degrees of freedom and the
component fields of the Kalb-Ramond superfield. We make also considerations
about the fermionic excitations that may appear in connection with the vortex
formation.

"Entanglement condition via su(2) and su(1,1) algebra using

on the product of uncertainties for two noncommuting observables than the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation, and as such, it can yield a stricter
separability condition in conjunction with partial transposition. In this
paper, using the Schr{\""o}dinger-Robertson uncertainty relation, the
separability condition previously derived from the su(2) and the su(1,1)
algebra is made stricter and refined to a form invariant with respect to local
phase shifts. Furthermore, a linear optical scheme is proposed to test this
invariant separability condition.

arbitrary measures be cut into four equal parts each by two suitably-chosen

helium atoms with a Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer(QMS). A demonstration is
undertaken with a plastic-covered $^{241}$Am $\alpha$-emitting source to detect
$\alpha$-rays stopped in the capsule. We successfully detect helium atoms that
diffuse out of the capsule by accumulating them for one to 20 hours in a closed
chamber. The detected amount is found to be proportional to the accumulation
time. Our method is applicable to probe $\alpha$-emitting radioactivity in bulk
material.

Magnetorotational Collapse of Population III Stars,"Yudai Suwa, Tomoya Takiwaki, Kei Kotake, Katsuhiko Sato","  We perform a series of two-dimensional magnetorotational core-collapse
simulations of Pop III stars. Changing the initial distributions of rotation
and magnetic fields prior to collapse in a parametric manner, we compute 19
models. By so doing, we systematically investigate how rotation and magnetic
fields affect the collapse dynamics and explore how the properties of the
black-hole formations and neutrino emissions could be affected. As for the
microphysics, we employ a realistic equation of state and approximate the
neutrino transfer by a multiflavour leakage scheme. With these computations, we
find that the jet-like explosions are obtained by the magnetodriven shock waves
if the initial magnetic field is as large as $10^{12}$ G. We point out that the
black-hole masses at the formation decrease with the initial field strength, on
the other hand, increase with the initial rotation rates. As for the neutrino
properties, we point out that the degree of the differential rotation plays an
important role to determine which species of the neutrino luminosity is more
dominant than the others. Furthermore, we find that the stronger magnetic
fields make the peak neutrino luminosities smaller, because the magnetic
pressure acts to halt the collapse in the central regions, leading to the
suppression of the releasable gravitational binding energies.

R-matrices in Rime,"O. Ogievetsky, T. Popov","  We replace the ice Ansatz on matrix solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by
a weaker condition which we call ""rime"". Rime solutions include the standard
Drinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime
Ansatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call ""strict
rime"". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective
vector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix
by a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the
components of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime
Ansatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to
a quantization of a classical ""boundary"" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and
Giaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as
a by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly
described in a rime form.
  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout
operators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative
classical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.
  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A
normal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant
of a certain quadratic polynomial. We also classify orderable quadratic rime
associative algebras.
  For the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution, there is a choice of the
multiparameters, for which it can be non-trivially rimed. However, not every
Belavin-Drinfeld triple admits a choice of the multiparameters for which it can
be rimed. We give a minimal example.

surfaces.

scale finite size systems, where the lattice is represented as the tiling of
pentagons. The system is on the hyperbolic plane, and the recursive structure
of the lattice makes it possible to apply the corner transfer matrix
renormalization group method. From the calculated nearest neighbor spin
correlation function and the spontaneous magnetization, it is concluded that
the phase transition of this model is mean-field like. One parameter
deformation of the corner Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic plane is discussed.

Inferring periodic orbits from spectra of simple shaped micro-lasers,"M. Lebental, N. Djellali, C. Arnaud, J.-S. Lauret, J. Zyss, R.
  Dubertrand, C. Schmit, and E. Bogomolny","  Dielectric micro-cavities are widely used as laser resonators and
characterizations of their spectra are of interest for various applications. We
experimentally investigate micro-lasers of simple shapes (Fabry-Perot, square,
pentagon, and disk). Their lasing spectra consist mainly of almost equidistant
peaks and the distance between peaks reveals the length of a quantized periodic
orbit. To measure this length with a good precision, it is necessary to take
into account different sources of refractive index dispersion. Our experimental
and numerical results agree with the superscar model describing the formation
of long-lived states in polygonal cavities. The limitations of the
two-dimensional approximation are briefly discussed in connection with
micro-disks.

family of representatives of all these curves up to geometric isomorphism and
we exhibit equations and the zeta function of all their twists. As an
application we obtain a direct computation of the cryptographic exponent of the
Jacobians of these curves.

Dynamic Effects Increasing Network Vulnerability to Cascading Failures,"Ingve Simonsen, Lubos Buzna, Karsten Peters, Stefan Bornholdt, and
  Dirk Helbing","  We study cascading failures in networks using a dynamical flow model based on
simple conservation and distribution laws to investigate the impact of
transient dynamics caused by the rebalancing of loads after an initial network
failure (triggering event). It is found that considering the flow dynamics may
imply reduced network robustness compared to previous static overload failure
models. This is due to the transient oscillations or overshooting in the loads,
when the flow dynamics adjusts to the new (remaining) network structure. We
obtain {\em upper} and {\em lower} limits to network robustness, and it is
shown that {\it two} time scales $\tau$ and $\tau_0$, defined by the network
dynamics, are important to consider prior to accurately addressing network
robustness or vulnerability. The robustness of networks showing cascading
failures is generally determined by a complex interplay between the network
topology and flow dynamics, where the ratio $\chi=\tau/\tau_0$ determines the
relative role of the two of them.

modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate by an external modulating field is
considered. The Ramsey fringes appear when a series of pulses of the excitation
field is applied. In both Rabi and Ramsey interrogations, there is a shift of

system. It is found that the Ramsey pattern itself retains information about
the accumulated relative phase between both ground and excited coherent modes.

The Allen-Cahn Action functional in higher dimensions,"Luca Mugnai, Matthias R\""oger","  The Allen-Cahn action functional is related to the probability of rare events
in the stochastically perturbed Allen-Cahn equation. Formal calculations
suggest a reduced action functional in the sharp interface limit. We prove in
two and three space dimensions the corresponding lower bound. One difficulty is
that diffuse interfaces may collapse in the limit. We therefore consider the
limit of diffuse surface area measures and introduce a generalized velocity and
generalized reduced action functional in a class of evolving measures. As a
corollary we obtain the Gamma convergence of the action functional in a class
of regularly evolving hypersurfaces.

Entanglement Cost for Sequences of Arbitrary Quantum States,Garry Bowen and Nilanjana Datta,"  The entanglement cost of arbitrary sequences of bipartite states is shown to

is shown to reduce to the regularized entanglement of formation when the n-th

"Line and continuum variability of two intermediate-redshift,
  high-luminosity quasars","D.Trevese, D.Paris, G. M. Stirpe, F.Vagnetti, V. Zitelli","  It has been shown that the luminosity of AGNs and the size of their broad
line region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert
nuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central
black hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta
emission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies
requires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration
relies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s
and z<0.4. We initiated a campaign for the monitoring of a few luminous,
intermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with
a 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to
continuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining
eventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed
simultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative
variability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and
methods of analysis. For the quasars PG1634+706 and PG1247+268 we obtain
light-curves respectively for CIII], MgII and for CIV, CIII] emission lines
with the relevant continua. During 3.2 years of observation, in the former case
no continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line
variability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line
variability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear
correlated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line
variability in a quasar with L~10^47 erg/s encourages the prosecution of the
campaign which should provide a black hole mass estimate in other 5-6 years,
constraining the M_BH-L relation in a poorly explored range of luminosity.

"Adiabatic passage in a three-state system with non-Markovian relaxation:
  The role of excited-state absorption and two-exciton processes",B.D. Fainberg and V.A. Gorbunov,"  The influence of excited-state absorption (ESA) and two-exciton processes on
a coherent population transfer with intense ultrashort chirped pulses in
molecular systems in solution has been studied. An unified treatment of
adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in such systems has been developed using a
three-state electronic system with relaxation treated as a diffusion on
electronic potential energy surfaces. We have shown that ESA has a profound
effect on coherent population transfer in large molecules that necessitates a
more accurate interpretation of experimental data. A simple and physically
clear model for ARP in molecules with three electronic states in solution has
been developed by extending the Landau-Zener calculations putting in a third
level to random crossing of levels. A method for quantum control of two-exciton
states in molecular complexes has been proposed.

of V_1 can be equivalently characterized by a ""single-pole property"" concerning
the pole structure of the (rational) correlation functions involving the
product phi_1(x_1) phi_2(x_2). This property is established for the dimension
d=2 of phi_1, phi_2. As an application we prove that any system of GCI scalar
fields of conformal dimension 2 (in four space-time dimensions) can be
presented as a (possibly infinite) superposition of products of free massless
fields.

"Impact of spin-zero particle-photon interactions on light polarization
  in external magnetic fields",Yi Liao (Nankai U.),"  If the recent PVLAS results on polarization changes of a linearly polarized
laser beam passing through a magnetic field are interpreted by an axion-like
particle, it is almost certain that it is not a standard QCD axion. Considering
this, we study the general effective interactions of photons with spin-zero
particles without restricting the latter to be a pseudo-scalar or a scalar,
i.e., a parity eigenstate. At the lowest order in effective field theory, there
are two dimension-5 interactions, each of which has previously been treated
separately for a pseudo-scalar or a scalar particle. By following the evolution
in an external magnetic field of the system of spin-zero particles and photons,
we compute the changes in light polarization and the transition probability for
two experimental set-ups: one-way propagation and round-trip propagation. While
the first may be relevant for astrophysical sources of spin-zero particles, the
second applies to laboratory optical experiments like PVLAS. In the one-way
propagation, interesting phenomena can occur for special configurations of
polarization where, for instance, transition occurs but light polarization does
not change. For the round-trip propagation, however, the standard results of
polarization changes for a pseudoscalar or a scalar are only modified by a
factor that depends on the relative strength of the two interactions.
"
A simple test of quantumness for a single system,Robert Alicki and Nicholas Van Ryn,"  We propose a simple test of quantumness which can decide whether for the
given set of accessible experimental data the classical model is insufficient.
Take two observables $ A,B$ such that for any state $\psi$ their mean values
satisfy $0\leq <\psi|A|\psi>\leq <\psi|B|\psi>\leq 1$. If there exists a state
$\phi$ such that the second moments fulfill the inequality $<\phi|A^2|\phi>
><\phi|B^2|\phi>$ then the system cannot be described by the classical
probabilistic scheme. An example of an optimal triple $(A,B,\phi)$ in the case
of a qubit is given.

"SPITZER: Accretion in Low Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs in the Lambda
  Orionis Cluster","D. Barrado y Navascues, J. R. Stauffer, M. Morales-Calderon, A. Bayo,
  G. Fazzio, T. Megeath, L. Allen, L. W. Hartmann, N. Calvet","  We present multi-wavelength optical and infrared photometry of 170 previously
known low mass stars and brown dwarfs of the 5 Myr Collinder 69 cluster (Lambda
Orionis). The new photometry supports cluster membership for most of them, with
less than 15% of the previous candidates identified as probable non-members.
The near infrared photometry allows us to identify stars with IR excesses, and
we find that the Class II population is very large, around 25% for stars (in
the spectral range M0 - M6.5) and 40% for brown dwarfs, down to 0.04 Msun,
despite the fact that the H(alpha) equivalent width is low for a significant
fraction of them. In addition, there are a number of substellar objects,
classified as Class III, that have optically thin disks. The Class II members
are distributed in an inhomogeneous way, lying preferentially in a filament
running toward the south-east. The IR excesses for the Collinder 69 members
range from pure Class II (flat or nearly flat spectra longward of 1 micron), to
transition disks with no near-IR excess but excesses beginning within the IRAC
wavelength range, to two stars with excess only detected at 24 micron.
Collinder 69 thus appears to be at an age where it provides a natural
laboratory for the study of primordial disks and their dissipation.

"A data-analysis driven comparison of analytic and numerical coalescing
  binary waveforms: nonspinning case","Yi Pan, Alessandra Buonanno, John G. Baker, Joan Centrella, Bernard J.
  Kelly, Sean T. McWilliams, Frans Pretorius and James R. van Meter","  We compare waveforms obtained by numerically evolving nonspinning binary
black holes to post-Newtonian (PN) template families currently used in the
search for gravitational waves by ground-based detectors. We find that the
time-domain 3.5PN template family, which includes the inspiral phase, has
fitting factors (FFs) >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 20
Msun. The time-domain 3.5PN effective-one-body template family, which includes
the inspiral, merger and ring-down phases, gives satisfactory signal-matching
performance with FFs >= 0.96 for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 120
Msun. If we introduce a cutoff frequency properly adjusted to the final
black-hole ring-down frequency, we find that the frequency-domain
stationary-phase-approximated template family at 3.5PN order has FFs >= 0.96
for binary systems with total mass M = 10 ~ 20 Msun. However, to obtain high
matching performances for larger binary masses, we need to either extend this
family to unphysical regions of the parameter space or introduce a 4PN order
coefficient in the frequency-domain GW phase. Finally, we find that the
phenomenological Buonanno-Chen-Vallisneri family has FFs >= 0.97 with total
mass M=10 ~ 120Msun. The main analyses use the noise spectral-density of LIGO,
but several tests are extended to VIRGO and advanced LIGO noise-spectral
densities.

"Quantum entanglement of decohered two-mode squeezed states in absorbing
  and amplifying environment",Phoenix S. Y. Poon and C. K. Law,"  We investigate the properties of quantum entanglement of two-mode squeezed
states interacting with linear baths with general gain and loss parameters. By
explicitly solving for \rho from the master equation, we determine analytical
expressions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \rho^{T_A} (the partial
transposition of density matrix \rho). In Fock space, \rho^{T_A} is shown to
maintain a block diagonal structure as the system evolves. In addition, we
discover that the decoherence induced by the baths would break the degeneracy
of \rho^{T_A}, and leads to a novel set of eigenvectors for the construction of
entanglement witness operators. Such eigenvectors are shown to be
time-independent, which is a signature of robust entanglement of two-mode
squeezed states in the presence of noise.
"
Some new observations on interpolation in the spectral unit ball,Gautam Bharali,"  We present several results associated to a holomorphic-interpolation problem
for the spectral unit ball \Omega_n, n\geq 2. We begin by showing that a known
necessary condition for the existence of a
$\mathcal{O}(D;\Omega_n)$-interpolant (D here being the unit disc in the
complex plane), given that the matricial data are non-derogatory, is not
sufficient. We provide next a new necessary condition for the solvability of
the two-point interpolation problem -- one which is not restricted only to
non-derogatory data, and which incorporates the Jordan structure of the
prescribed data. We then use some of the ideas used in deducing the latter
result to prove a Schwarz-type lemma for holomorphic self-maps of \Omega_n,
n\geq 2.

The microcanonical ensemble of the ideal relativistic quantum gas,"F. Becattini, L. Ferroni (University of Florence and INFN Florence)","  We derive the microcanonical partition function of the ideal relativistic
quantum gas of spinless bosons in a quantum field framework as an expansion
over fixed multiplicities. Our calculation generalizes well known expressions
in literature in that it does not introduce any large volume approximation and
it is valid at any volume. We discuss the issues concerned with the definition
of the microcanonical ensemble for a free quantum field at volumes comparable
with the Compton wavelength and provide a consistent prescription of
calculating the microcanonical partition function, which is finite at finite
volume and yielding the correct thermodynamic limit. Besides an immaterial
overall factor, the obtained expression turns out to be the same as in the
non-relativistic multi-particle approach. This work is introductory to derive
the most general expression of the microcanonical partition function fixing the
maximal set of observables of the Poincare' group.

The spin-flip phenomenon in supermassive black hole binary mergers,"L\'aszl\'o \'A. Gergely, Peter L. Biermann","  Massive merging black holes will be the primary sources of powerful
gravitational waves at low frequency, and will permit to test general
relativity with candidate galaxies close to a binary black hole merger. In this
paper we identify the typical mass ratio of the two black holes but then show
that the distance when gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative
effect (over dynamical friction) does not depend on the mass ratio. However the
dynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For the
typical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by a
rapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. This
already occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analytically
by post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with a
super-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively a
powerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of a
thick disk. These specific galaxies are thus candidates for a merger of two
black holes to happen in the astronomically near future.
"
On the Young-Fibonacci insertion algorithm,Janvier Nzeutchap,"  This work is concerned with some properties of the Young-Fibonacci insertion
algorithm and its relation with Fomin's growth diagrams. It also investigates a
relation between the combinatorics of Young-Fibonacci tableaux and the study of
Okada's algebra associated to the Young-Fibonacci lattice. The original
algorithm was introduced by Roby and we redefine it in such a way that both the
insertion and recording tableaux of any permutation are \emph{conveniently}
interpreted as chains in the Young-Fibonacci lattice. A property of
Killpatrick's evacuation is given a simpler proof, but this evacuation is no
longer needed in making Roby's and Fomin's constructions coincide. We provide
the set of Young-Fibonacci tableaux of size $n$ with a structure of graded
poset, induced by the weak order on permutations of the symmetric group, and
realized by transitive closure of elementary transformations on tableaux. We
show that this poset gives a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients
in the transition matrix from the analogue of complete symmetric functions to
analogue of the Schur functions in Okada's algebra. We end with a quite similar
observation for four posets on Young-tableaux studied by Taskin.

"Thermoelectric response near a quantum critical point: the case of
  CeCoIn5","K. Izawa, K. Behnia, Y. Matsuda, H. Shishido, R.Settai, Y. Onuki and
  J. Flouquet","  We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K
and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum
criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the
Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down
to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient
to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold
of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state,
the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other
superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.
"
Dissipative dynamics of superfluid vortices at non-zero temperatures,Natalia G. Berloff and Anthony J. Youd,"  We consider the evolution and dissipation of vortex rings in a condensate at
non-zero temperature, in the context of the classical field approximation,
based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The temperature in
such a system is fully determined by the total number density and the number
density of the condensate. A vortex ring is introduced into a condensate in a
state of thermal equilibrium, and interacts with non-condensed particles. These
interactions lead to a gradual decrease in the vortex line density, until the
vortex ring completely disappears. We show that the square of the vortex line
length changes linearly with time, and obtain the corresponding universal decay
law. We relate this to mutual friction coefficients in the fundamental equation
of vortex motion in superfluids.

"Critical edge behavior in unitary random matrix ensembles and the thirty
  fourth Painleve transcendent","A.R. Its, A.B.J. Kuijlaars, and J. Ostensson","  We describe a new universality class for unitary invariant random matrix
ensembles. It arises in the double scaling limit of ensembles of random $n
\times n$ Hermitian matrices $Z_{n,N}^{-1} |\det M|^{2\alpha} e^{-N \Tr V(M)}
dM$ with $\alpha > -1/2$, where the factor $|\det M|^{2\alpha}$ induces
critical eigenvalue behavior near the origin. Under the assumption that the
limiting mean eigenvalue density associated with $V$ is regular, and that the
origin is a right endpoint of its support, we compute the limiting eigenvalue
correlation kernel in the double scaling limit as $n, N \to \infty$ such that
$n^{2/3}(n/N-1) = O(1)$. We use the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for the
Riemann-Hilbert problem for polynomials on the line orthogonal with respect to
the weight $|x|^{2\alpha} e^{-NV(x)}$. Our main attention is on the
construction of a local parametrix near the origin by means of the
$\psi$-functions associated with a distinguished solution of the Painleve XXXIV
equation. This solution is related to a particular solution of the Painleve II
equation, which however is different from the usual Hastings-McLeod solution.

"Vibrational effects on low-temperature properties of molecular
  conductors","Jernej Mravlje, Anton Ramsak, Rok Zitko","  We calculate characteristic correlation functions for the Anderson model with
additional phonon-assisted coupling to the odd conduction channel. This model
describes, for example, the behavior of a molecule embedded between two
electrodes in linear transport experiments where the position of the molecule
with respect to the leads affects the tunneling amplitudes. We use variational
projection-operator method and numerical renormalization group (NRG) method.
The spin is Kondo screened either by even or odd conduction channel depending
on the gate voltage and electron-phonon coupling. However, in all regimes the
gate-voltage dependence of the zero temperature conductance is found to be
qualitatively the same as in the model with no coupling to the vibrational
mode.

"
Information-Based Asset Pricing,"Dorje C. Brody, Lane P. Hughston, Andrea Macrina","  A new framework for asset price dynamics is introduced in which the concept
of noisy information about future cash flows is used to derive the price
processes. In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.
Each cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a
function of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.
With each such ""X-factor"" we associate a market information process, the values
of which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of
two terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;
the other represents ""noise"". The noise term is modelled by an independent
Brownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the
aggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is
given by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral
measure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When
the cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit
model is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on
dividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the
price of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The
information-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin
of stochastic volatility.

Strange dibaryon resonance in the anti-KNN--piYN system,Y. Ikeda and T. Sato,"  Three-body resonances in the \bar{K}NN system have been studied within a
framework of the \bar{K}NN-\pi YN coupled hannel Faddeev equation. By solving
the three-body equation the energy dependence of the resonant \bar{K}N
amplitude is fully taken into account. The S-matrix pole has been investigated
from the eigenvalue of the kernel with the analytic continuation of the
scattering amplitude on the unphysical Riemann sheet. The \barKN interaction is
constructed from the leading order term of the chiral Lagrangian using
relativistic kinematics. The \Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamically generated
in this model, where the \bar{K}N interaction parameters are fitted to the data
of scattering length. As a result we find a three-body resonance of the strange
dibaryon system with binding energy, B~79 MeV, and width, \Gamma~74 MeV. The
energy of the three-body resonance is found to be sensitive to the model of the
I=0 \barKN interaction.

Some notes on analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact manifolds,Neil Seshadri,"  We propose a definition for analytic torsion of the Rumin complex on contact

of zeta functions of a fourth-order modified Rumin Laplacian. The regular value
at zero (before differentiation) of this well-chosen combination of zeta
functions is shown to be a contact invariant. The variation of our analytic
torsion is given as the integral of local terms, together with a global term
coming from the null-space of the Laplacian.

theory forms only a single star system. It is proved that the nonlinear

correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field

Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of
homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the
so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and
a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation.
Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for

diffractive Higgs production through pomeron fusion, must be multiplied by a
factor for the survival probability, to isolate the Higgs signal and reduce the

the two cases for pomeron fusion and photon fusion, are competitive.

Pure inductive limit state and Kolmogorov's property,Anilesh Mohari,"  Let $(\clb,\lambda_t,\psi)$ be a $C^*$-dynamical system where $(\lambda_t: t

$(\lambda_t)$ invariant state on the $C^*$ subalgebra $\clb$ and $\IT_+$ is
either non-negative integers or real numbers. The central aim of this
exposition is to find a useful criteria for the inductive limit state $\clb
\raro^{\lambda_t} \clb$ canonically associated with $\psi$ to be pure. We
achieve this by exploring the minimal weak forward and backward Markov
processes associated with the Markov semigroup on the corner von-Neumann
algebra of the support projection of the state $\psi$ to prove that
Kolmogorov's property [Mo2] of the Markov semigroup is a sufficient condition
for the inductive state to be pure. As an application of this criteria we find
a sufficient condition for a translation invariant factor state on a one
dimensional quantum spin chain to be pure. This criteria in a sense complements
criteria obtained in [BJKW,Mo2] as we could go beyond lattice symmetric states.

"Vacuum Polarization by a Magnetic Flux Tube at Finite Temperature in the
  Cosmic String Spacetime",J. Spinelly and E. R. Bezerra de Mello,"  In this paper we analyse the effect produced by the temperature in the vacuum
polarization associated with charged massless scalar field in the presence of
magnetic flux tube in the cosmic string spacetime. Three different
configurations of magnetic fields are taken into account: $(i)$ a homogeneous
field inside the tube, $(ii)$ a field proportional to $1/r$ and $(iii)$ a
cylindrical shell with $\delta$-function. In these three cases, the axis of the
infinitely long tube of radius $R$ coincides with the cosmic string. Because
the complexity of this analysis in the region inside the tube, we consider the
thermal effect in the region outside. In order to develop this analysis, we
construct the thermal Green function associated with this system for the three
above mentioned situations considering points in the region outside the tube.
We explicitly calculate in the high-temperature limit, the thermal average of
the field square and the energy-momentum tensor.

Single pion electro-- and neutrinoproduction on heavy targets,"E. A. Paschos, I. Schienbein, J.-Y. Yu","  We present a calculation of single pion electroproduction cross sections on
heavy targets in the kinematic region of the Delta(1232) resonance. Final state
interactions of the pions are taken into account using the pion multiple
scattering model of Adler, Nussinov and Paschos (ANP model). For
electroproduction and neutral current reactions we obtain results for carbon,
oxygen, argon and iron targets and find a significant reduction of the
W-spectra for pi^0 as compared to the free nucleon case. On the other hand, the
charged pion spectra are only little affected by final state interactions.
Measurements of such cross sections with the CLAS detector at JLAB could help
to improve our understanding of pion rescattering effects and serve as
important/valuable input for calculations of single pion neutrinoproduction on
heavy targets relevant for current and future long baseline neutrino
experiments. Two ratios, in Eq. (3.8) and (3.10), will test important
properties of the model.

"Competition between local and nonlocal dissipation effects in
  two-dimensional quantum Josephson junction arrays","T. P. Polak, T. K. Kopec","  We discuss the local and nonlocal dissipation effects on the existence of the
global phase coherence transitions in two dimensional Josephson-coupled
junctions. The quantum phase transitions are also examined for various lattice
geometries: square, triangular and honeycomb. The T=0 superconductor-insulator
phase transition is analyzed as a function of several control parameters which
include self-capacitance and junction capacitance and both local and nonlocal
dissipation effects. We found the critical value of the nonlocal dissipation
parameter \alpha_{1} depends on a geometry of the lattice. The critical value
of the normal state conductance seems to be difficult to obtain experimentally
if we take into consideration different damping mechanisms which are presented
in real physical systems.

Substrate-induced bandgap in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride,"Gianluca Giovannetti, Petr A. Khomyakov, Geert Brocks, Paul J. Kelly
  and Jeroen van den Brink","  We determine the electronic structure of a graphene sheet on top of a
lattice-matched hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) substrate using ab initio
density functional calculations. The most stable configuration has one carbon
atom on top of a boron atom, the other centered above a BN ring. The resulting
inequivalence of the two carbon sites leads to the opening of a gap of 53 meV
at the Dirac points of graphene and to finite masses for the Dirac fermions.
Alternative orientations of the graphene sheet on the BN substrate generate
similar band gaps and masses. The band gap induced by the BN surface can
greatly improve room temperature pinch-off characteristics of graphene-based

Coherent dynamics of domain formation in the Bose Ferromagnet,"Qiang Gu, Haibo Qiu","  We present a theory to describe domain formation observed very recently in a

factor is introduced to characterize the symmetry breaking of M_F=\pm 1
components for the F=1 ferromagnetic condensate. We demonstrate that the domain
formation is a co-effect of the quantum coherence and the thermal relaxation. A
thermally enhanced quantum-oscillation is observed during the dynamical process
of the domain formation. And the spatial separation of domains leads to
significant decay of the M_F=0 component fraction in an initial M_F=0
condensate.

parafermionic conformal field theory, and of the corresponding string
cosmology. In specific examples, we compute the norm of the wave-function and
comment on its behavior as a function of moduli.

"Query on Negative Temperature, Internal Interactions and Decrease of
  Entropy",Yi-Fang Chang,"  After negative temperature is restated, we find that it will derive
necessarily decrease of entropy. Negative temperature is based on the Kelvin
scale and the condition dU>0 and dS<0. Conversely, there is also negative
temperature for dU<0 and dS>0. But, negative temperature is contradiction with
usual meaning of temperature and with some basic concepts of physics and
mathematics. It is a question in nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We proposed a
possibility of decrease of entropy due to fluctuation magnified and internal
interactions in some isolated systems. From this we discuss some possible
examples and theories.

"Absence of the Fifth Force Problem in a Model with Spontaneously Broken
  Dilatation Symmetry",E. I. Guendelman and A. B. Kaganovich,"  A scale invariant model containing dilaton $\phi$ and dust (as a model of
matter) is studied where the shift symmetry $\phi\to\phi +const.$ is
spontaneously broken at the classical level due to intrinsic features of the
model. The dilaton to matter coupling ""constant"" $f$ appears to be dependent of
the matter density. In normal conditions, i.e. when the matter energy density
is many orders of magnitude larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark
energy density, $f$ becomes less than the ratio of the ""mass of the vacuum"" in
the volume occupied by the matter to the Planck mass. The model yields this
kind of ""Archimedes law"" without any especial (intended for this) choice of the
underlying action and without fine tuning of the parameters. The model not only
explains why all attempts to discover a scalar force correction to Newtonian
gravity were unsuccessful so far but also predicts that in the near future
there is no chance to detect such corrections in the astronomical measurements
as well as in the specially designed fifth force experiments on intermediate,
short (like millimeter) and even ultrashort (a few nanometer) ranges. This
prediction is alternative to predictions of other known models.

Dark matter caustics and the enhancement of self-annihilation flux,"Roya Mohayaee, Sergei Shandarin, Joseph Silk","  Cold dark matter haloes are populated by caustics, which are yet to be
resolved in N-body simulations or observed in the Universe. Secondary infall
model provides a paradigm for the study of caustics in ""typical"" haloes
assuming that they have had no major mergers and have grown only by smooth
accretion. This is a particular characteristic of the smallest dark matter
haloes of about 10^{-5} Mo, which although ""atypical"" contain no substructures
and could have survived until now with no major mergers. Thus using this model
as the first guidline, we evaluate the neutralino self-annihilation flux for
these haloes. Our results show that caustics could leave a distinct sawteeth
signature on the differential and cumulative fluxes coming from the outer
regions of these haloes. The total annihilation signal from the regions away
from the centre can be boosted by about forty percents.

"Search for a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ppbar
  collisions","D0 Collaboration, V. Abazov, et al","  We describe a search for the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of 105
GeV/c^2 to 145 GeV/c^2 in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
approximately 450 pb^{-1} collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab
Tevatron ppbar collider at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The Higgs boson
is required to be produced in association with a Z boson, and the Z boson is
required to decay to either electrons or muons with the Higgs boson decaying to
a bbbar pair. The data are well described by the expected background, leading
to 95% confidence level cross section upper limits sigma(\ppbar\to ZH)x
B(H\to\bbbar) in the range of 3.1 pb to 4.4 pb.
